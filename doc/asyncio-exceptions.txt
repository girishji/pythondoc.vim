exception asyncio.TimeoutError

   A deprecated alias of "TimeoutError", raised when the operation has
   exceeded the given deadline.

   Changed in version 3.11: This class was made an alias of

   Changed in version 3.8: "CancelledError" is now a subclass of
   "BaseException" rather than "Exception".
