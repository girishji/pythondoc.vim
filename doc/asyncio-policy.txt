Policies
********

An event loop policy is a global object used to get and set the
current event loop, as well as create new event loops. The default
policy can be replaced with built-in alternatives to use different
event loop implementations, or substituted by a custom policy that can
override these behaviors.

The policy object gets and sets a separate event loop per _context_.
This is per-thread by default, though custom policies could define
_context_ differently.

Custom event loop policies can control the behavior of
"get_event_loop()", "set_event_loop()", and "new_event_loop()".

Policy objects should implement the APIs defined in the
"AbstractEventLoopPolicy" abstract base class.


Getting and Setting the Policy
==============================

The following functions can be used to get and set the policy for the
current process:

                        *get_event_loop_policy()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
asyncio.get_event_loop_policy()

   Return the current process-wide policy.

                        *set_event_loop_policy()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(policy)

   Set the current process-wide policy to _policy_.

   If _policy_ is set to "None", the default policy is restored.


Policy Objects
==============

The abstract event loop policy base class is defined as follows:

                        *AbstractEventLoopPolicy..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy

   An abstract base class for asyncio policies.

       *AbstractEventLoopPolicy.get_event_loop()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   get_event_loop()

      Get the event loop for the current context.

      Return an event loop object implementing the "AbstractEventLoop"
      interface.

      This method should never return "None".

      Changed in version 3.6.

       *AbstractEventLoopPolicy.set_event_loop()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   set_event_loop(loop)

      Set the event loop for the current context to _loop_.

       *AbstractEventLoopPolicy.new_event_loop()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   new_event_loop()

      Create and return a new event loop object.

      This method should never return "None".

    *AbstractEventLoopPolicy.get_child_watcher()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   get_child_watcher()

      Get a child process watcher object.

      Return a watcher object implementing the "AbstractChildWatcher"
      interface.

      This function is Unix specific.

      Deprecated since version 3.12.

    *AbstractEventLoopPolicy.set_child_watcher()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   set_child_watcher(watcher)

      Set the current child process watcher to _watcher_.

      This function is Unix specific.

      Deprecated since version 3.12.

asyncio ships with the following built-in policies:

                         *DefaultEventLoopPolicy..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy

   The default asyncio policy.  Uses "SelectorEventLoop" on Unix and
   "ProactorEventLoop" on Windows.

   There is no need to install the default policy manually. asyncio is
   configured to use the default policy automatically.

   Changed in version 3.8: On Windows, "ProactorEventLoop" is now used
   by default.

   Deprecated since version 3.12: The "get_event_loop()" method of the
   default asyncio policy now emits a "DeprecationWarning" if there is
   no current event loop set and it decides to create one. In some
   future Python release this will become an error.

                 *WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy

   An alternative event loop policy that uses the "SelectorEventLoop"
   event loop implementation.

   Availability: Windows.

                 *WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy

   An alternative event loop policy that uses the "ProactorEventLoop"
   event loop implementation.

   Availability: Windows.


Process Watchers
================

A process watcher allows customization of how an event loop monitors
child processes on Unix. Specifically, the event loop needs to know
when a child process has exited.

In asyncio, child processes are created with
"create_subprocess_exec()" and "loop.subprocess_exec()" functions.

asyncio defines the "AbstractChildWatcher" abstract base class, which
child watchers should implement, and has four different
implementations: "ThreadedChildWatcher" (configured to be used by
default), "MultiLoopChildWatcher", "SafeChildWatcher", and
"FastChildWatcher".

See also the Subprocess and Threads section.

The following two functions can be used to customize the child process
watcher implementation used by the asyncio event loop:

                            *get_child_watcher()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
asyncio.get_child_watcher()

   Return the current child watcher for the current policy.

   Deprecated since version 3.12.

                            *set_child_watcher()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
asyncio.set_child_watcher(watcher)

   Set the current child watcher to _watcher_ for the current policy.
   _watcher_ must implement methods defined in the
   "AbstractChildWatcher" base class.

   Deprecated since version 3.12.

Note:

  Third-party event loops implementations might not support custom
  child watchers.  For such event loops, using "set_child_watcher()"
  might be prohibited or have no effect.

                           *AbstractChildWatcher..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher


       *AbstractChildWatcher.add_child_handler()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   add_child_handler(pid, callback, *args)

      Register a new child handler.

      Arrange for "callback(pid, returncode, *args)" to be called when
      a process with PID equal to _pid_ terminates.  Specifying
      another callback for the same process replaces the previous
      handler.

      The _callback_ callable must be thread-safe.

    *AbstractChildWatcher.remove_child_handler()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   remove_child_handler(pid)

      Removes the handler for process with PID equal to _pid_.

      The function returns "True" if the handler was successfully
      removed, "False" if there was nothing to remove.

             *AbstractChildWatcher.attach_loop()..asyncio-policy.txt;*
   attach_loop(loop)

      Attach the watcher to an event loop.

      If the watcher was previously attached to an event loop, then it
      is first detached before attaching to the new loop.

      Note: loop may be "None".

   is_active()    *AbstractChildWatcher.is_active()..asyncio-policy.txt;*

      Return "True" if the watcher is ready to use.

      Spawning a subprocess with _inactive_ current child watcher
      raises "RuntimeError".

      New in version 3.8.

   close()            *AbstractChildWatcher.close()..asyncio-policy.txt;*

      Close the watcher.

      This method has to be called to ensure that underlying resources
      are cleaned-up.

   Deprecated since version 3.12.

                           *ThreadedChildWatcher..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.ThreadedChildWatcher

   This implementation starts a new waiting thread for every
   subprocess spawn.

   It works reliably even when the asyncio event loop is run in a non-
   main OS thread.

   There is no noticeable overhead when handling a big number of
   children (_O(1)_ each time a child terminates), but starting a
   thread per process requires extra memory.

   This watcher is used by default.

   New in version 3.8.

                          *MultiLoopChildWatcher..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.MultiLoopChildWatcher

   This implementation registers a "SIGCHLD" signal handler on
   instantiation. That can break third-party code that installs a
   custom handler for "SIGCHLD" signal.

   The watcher avoids disrupting other code spawning processes by
   polling every process explicitly on a "SIGCHLD" signal.

   There is no limitation for running subprocesses from different
   threads once the watcher is installed.

   The solution is safe but it has a significant overhead when
   handling a big number of processes (_O(n)_ each time a "SIGCHLD" is
   received).

   New in version 3.8.

   Deprecated since version 3.12.

                               *SafeChildWatcher..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.SafeChildWatcher

   This implementation uses active event loop from the main thread to
   handle "SIGCHLD" signal. If the main thread has no running event
   loop another thread cannot spawn a subprocess ("RuntimeError" is
   raised).

   The watcher avoids disrupting other code spawning processes by
   polling every process explicitly on a "SIGCHLD" signal.

   This solution is as safe as "MultiLoopChildWatcher" and has the
   same _O(N)_ complexity but requires a running event loop in the
   main thread to work.

   Deprecated since version 3.12.

                               *FastChildWatcher..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.FastChildWatcher

   This implementation reaps every terminated processes by calling
   "os.waitpid(-1)" directly, possibly breaking other code spawning
   processes and waiting for their termination.

   There is no noticeable overhead when handling a big number of
   children (_O(1)_ each time a child terminates).

   This solution requires a running event loop in the main thread to
   work, as "SafeChildWatcher".

   Deprecated since version 3.12.

                              *PidfdChildWatcher..asyncio-policy.txt;*
class asyncio.PidfdChildWatcher

   This implementation polls process file descriptors (pidfds) to
   await child process termination. In some respects,
   "PidfdChildWatcher" is a “Goldilocks” child watcher implementation.
   It doesn’t require signals or threads, doesn’t interfere with any
   processes launched outside the event loop, and scales linearly with
   the number of subprocesses launched by the event loop. The main
   disadvantage is that pidfds are specific to Linux, and only work on
   recent (5.3+) kernels.

   New in version 3.9.


Custom Policies
===============

To implement a new event loop policy, it is recommended to subclass
"DefaultEventLoopPolicy" and override the methods for which custom
behavior is wanted, e.g.:
>
   class MyEventLoopPolicy(asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy):

       def get_event_loop(self):
           """Get the event loop.

           This may be None or an instance of EventLoop.
           """
           loop = super().get_event_loop()
           # Do something with loop ...
           return loop

   asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(MyEventLoopPolicy())
