Streams
*******

**Source code:** Lib/asyncio/streams.py

======================================================================

Streams are high-level async/await-ready primitives to work with
network connections.  Streams allow sending and receiving data without
using callbacks or low-level protocols and transports.

Here is an example of a TCP echo client written using asyncio streams:
>
   import asyncio

   async def tcp_echo_client(message):
       reader, writer = await asyncio.open_connection(
           '127.0.0.1', 8888)

       print(f'Send: {message!r}')
       writer.write(message.encode())
       await writer.drain()

       data = await reader.read(100)
       print(f'Received: {data.decode()!r}')

       print('Close the connection')
       writer.close()
       await writer.wait_closed()

   asyncio.run(tcp_echo_client('Hello World!'))
<
See also the Examples section below.

-[ Stream Functions ]-

The following top-level asyncio functions can be used to create and
work with streams:

                               *open_connection()..asyncio-stream.txt*
coroutine asyncio.open_connection(host=None, port=None, *, limit=None, ssl=None, family=0, proto=0, flags=0, sock=None, local_addr=None, server_hostname=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None, ssl_shutdown_timeout=None, happy_eyeballs_delay=None, interleave=None)

   Establish a network connection and return a pair of "(reader,
   writer)" objects.

   The returned _reader_ and _writer_ objects are instances of
   "StreamReader" and "StreamWriter" classes.

   _limit_ determines the buffer size limit used by the returned
   "StreamReader" instance.  By default the _limit_ is set to 64 KiB.

   The rest of the arguments are passed directly to
   "loop.create_connection()".

   Note:

     The _sock_ argument transfers ownership of the socket to the
     "StreamWriter" created. To close the socket, call its "close()"
     method.

   Changed in version 3.7: Added the _ssl_handshake_timeout_
   parameter.

   New in version 3.8: Added _happy_eyeballs_delay_ and _interleave_
   parameters.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.11: Added the _ssl_shutdown_timeout_
   parameter.

                                  *start_server()..asyncio-stream.txt*
coroutine asyncio.start_server(client_connected_cb, host=None, port=None, *, limit=None, family=socket.AF_UNSPEC, flags=socket.AI_PASSIVE, sock=None, backlog=100, ssl=None, reuse_address=None, reuse_port=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None, ssl_shutdown_timeout=None, start_serving=True)

   Start a socket server.

   The _client_connected_cb_ callback is called whenever a new client
   connection is established.  It receives a "(reader, writer)" pair
   as two arguments, instances of the "StreamReader" and
   "StreamWriter" classes.

   _client_connected_cb_ can be a plain callable or a coroutine
   function; if it is a coroutine function, it will be automatically
   scheduled as a "Task".

   _limit_ determines the buffer size limit used by the returned
   "StreamReader" instance.  By default the _limit_ is set to 64 KiB.

   The rest of the arguments are passed directly to
   "loop.create_server()".

   Note:

     The _sock_ argument transfers ownership of the socket to the
     server created. To close the socket, call the server’s "close()"
     method.

   Changed in version 3.7: Added the _ssl_handshake_timeout_ and
   _start_serving_ parameters.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.11: Added the _ssl_shutdown_timeout_
   parameter.

-[ Unix Sockets ]-

                          *open_unix_connection()..asyncio-stream.txt*
coroutine asyncio.open_unix_connection(path=None, *, limit=None, ssl=None, sock=None, server_hostname=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None, ssl_shutdown_timeout=None)

      Establish a Unix socket connection and return a pair of
      "(reader, writer)".

      Similar to "open_connection()" but operates on Unix sockets.

      See also the documentation of "loop.create_unix_connection()".

      Note:

        The _sock_ argument transfers ownership of the socket to the
        "StreamWriter" created. To close the socket, call its
        "close()" method.

      Availability: Unix.

      Changed in version 3.7: Added the _ssl_handshake_timeout_
      parameter. The _path_ parameter can now be a _path-like object_

      Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.11: Added the _ssl_shutdown_timeout_
   parameter.

                             *start_unix_server()..asyncio-stream.txt*
coroutine asyncio.start_unix_server(client_connected_cb, path=None, *, limit=None, sock=None, backlog=100, ssl=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None, ssl_shutdown_timeout=None, start_serving=True)

   Start a Unix socket server.

   Similar to "start_server()" but works with Unix sockets.

   See also the documentation of "loop.create_unix_server()".

   Note:

     The _sock_ argument transfers ownership of the socket to the
     server created. To close the socket, call the server’s "close()"
     method.

   Availability: Unix.

   Changed in version 3.7: Added the _ssl_handshake_timeout_ and
   _start_serving_ parameters. The _path_ parameter can now be a
   _path-like object_.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.11: Added the _ssl_shutdown_timeout_
   parameter.


StreamReader
============

class asyncio.StreamReader          *StreamReader..asyncio-stream.txt*

   Represents a reader object that provides APIs to read data from the
   IO stream. As an _asynchronous iterable_, the object supports the
   "async for" statement.

   It is not recommended to instantiate _StreamReader_ objects
   directly; use "open_connection()" and "start_server()" instead.

   coroutine read(n=-1)         *StreamReader.read()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Read up to _n_ bytes from the stream.

      If _n_ is not provided or set to "-1", read until EOF, then
      return all read "bytes". If EOF was received and the internal
      buffer is empty, return an empty "bytes" object.

      If _n_ is "0", return an empty "bytes" object immediately.

      If _n_ is positive, return at most _n_ available "bytes" as soon
      as at least 1 byte is available in the internal buffer. If EOF
      is received before any byte is read, return an empty "bytes"
      object.

   coroutine readline()     *StreamReader.readline()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Read one line, where “line” is a sequence of bytes ending with
      "\n".

      If EOF is received and "\n" was not found, the method returns
      partially read data.

      If EOF is received and the internal buffer is empty, return an
      empty "bytes" object.

                      *StreamReader.readexactly()..asyncio-stream.txt*
   coroutine readexactly(n)

      Read exactly _n_ bytes.

      Raise an "IncompleteReadError" if EOF is reached before _n_ can
      be read.  Use the "IncompleteReadError.partial" attribute to get
      the partially read data.

                        *StreamReader.readuntil()..asyncio-stream.txt*
   coroutine readuntil(separator=b'\n')

      Read data from the stream until _separator_ is found.

      On success, the data and separator will be removed from the
      internal buffer (consumed). Returned data will include the
      separator at the end.

      If the amount of data read exceeds the configured stream limit,
      a "LimitOverrunError" exception is raised, and the data is left
      in the internal buffer and can be read again.

      If EOF is reached before the complete separator is found, an
      "IncompleteReadError" exception is raised, and the internal
      buffer is reset.  The "IncompleteReadError.partial" attribute
      may contain a portion of the separator.

      New in version 3.5.2.

   at_eof()                   *StreamReader.at_eof()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Return "True" if the buffer is empty and "feed_eof()" was
      called.


StreamWriter
============

class asyncio.StreamWriter          *StreamWriter..asyncio-stream.txt*

   Represents a writer object that provides APIs to write data to the
   IO stream.

   It is not recommended to instantiate _StreamWriter_ objects
   directly; use "open_connection()" and "start_server()" instead.

   write(data)                 *StreamWriter.write()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      The method attempts to write the _data_ to the underlying socket
      immediately. If that fails, the data is queued in an internal
      write buffer until it can be sent.

      The method should be used along with the "drain()" method:
>
         stream.write(data)
         await stream.drain()
<
   writelines(data)       *StreamWriter.writelines()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      The method writes a list (or any iterable) of bytes to the
      underlying socket immediately. If that fails, the data is queued
      in an internal write buffer until it can be sent.

      The method should be used along with the "drain()" method:
>
         stream.writelines(lines)
         await stream.drain()
<
   close()                     *StreamWriter.close()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      The method closes the stream and the underlying socket.

      The method should be used, though not mandatory, along with the
      "wait_closed()" method:
>
         stream.close()
         await stream.wait_closed()
<
   can_write_eof()     *StreamWriter.can_write_eof()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Return "True" if the underlying transport supports the
      "write_eof()" method, "False" otherwise.

   write_eof()             *StreamWriter.write_eof()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Close the write end of the stream after the buffered write data
      is flushed.

   transport                 *StreamWriter.transport..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Return the underlying asyncio transport.

                   *StreamWriter.get_extra_info()..asyncio-stream.txt*
   get_extra_info(name, default=None)

      Access optional transport information; see
      "BaseTransport.get_extra_info()" for details.

   coroutine drain()           *StreamWriter.drain()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Wait until it is appropriate to resume writing to the stream.
      Example:
>
         writer.write(data)
         await writer.drain()
<
      This is a flow control method that interacts with the underlying
      IO write buffer.  When the size of the buffer reaches the high
      watermark, _drain()_ blocks until the size of the buffer is
      drained down to the low watermark and writing can be resumed.
      When there is nothing to wait for, the "drain()" returns
      immediately.

                        *StreamWriter.start_tls()..asyncio-stream.txt*
   coroutine start_tls(sslcontext, \*, server_hostname=None, ssl_handshake_timeout=None, ssl_shutdown_timeout=None)

      Upgrade an existing stream-based connection to TLS.

      Parameters:

      * _sslcontext_: a configured instance of "SSLContext".

      * _server_hostname_: sets or overrides the host name that the
        target server’s certificate will be matched against.

      * _ssl_handshake_timeout_ is the time in seconds to wait for the
        TLS handshake to complete before aborting the connection.
        "60.0" seconds if "None" (default).

      * _ssl_shutdown_timeout_ is the time in seconds to wait for the
        SSL shutdown to complete before aborting the connection.
        "30.0" seconds if "None" (default).

      New in version 3.11.

      Changed in version 3.12: Added the _ssl_shutdown_timeout_
      parameter.

   is_closing()           *StreamWriter.is_closing()..asyncio-stream.txt*

      Return "True" if the stream is closed or in the process of being
      closed.

      New in version 3.7.

                      *StreamWriter.wait_closed()..asyncio-stream.txt*
   coroutine wait_closed()

      Wait until the stream is closed.

      Should be called after "close()" to wait until the underlying
      connection is closed, ensuring that all data has been flushed
      before e.g. exiting the program.

      New in version 3.7.

Register an open socket to wait for data using streams
------------------------------------------------------

Coroutine waiting until a socket receives data using the
"open_connection()" function:
>
   import asyncio
   import socket

   async def wait_for_data():
       # Get a reference to the current event loop because
       # we want to access low-level APIs.
       loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

       # Create a pair of connected sockets.
       rsock, wsock = socket.socketpair()

       # Register the open socket to wait for data.
       reader, writer = await asyncio.open_connection(sock=rsock)

       # Simulate the reception of data from the network
       loop.call_soon(wsock.send, 'abc'.encode())

       # Wait for data
       data = await reader.read(100)

       # Got data, we are done: close the socket
       print("Received:", data.decode())
       writer.close()
       await writer.wait_closed()

       # Close the second socket
       wsock.close()

   asyncio.run(wait_for_data())
<
See also:

  The register an open socket to wait for data using a protocol
  example uses a low-level protocol and the "loop.create_connection()"
  method.

  The watch a file descriptor for read events example uses the low-
  level "loop.add_reader()" method to watch a file descriptor.
