Synchronization Primitives
**************************

**Source code:** Lib/asyncio/locks.py

======================================================================

asyncio synchronization primitives are designed to be similar to those
of the "threading" module with two important caveats:

* asyncio primitives are not thread-safe, therefore they should not be
  used for OS thread synchronization (use "threading" for that);

* methods of these synchronization primitives do not accept the
  _timeout_ argument; use the "asyncio.wait_for()" function to perform
  operations with timeouts.

asyncio has the following basic synchronization primitives:

* "Lock"

* "Event"

* "Condition"

* "Semaphore"

* "BoundedSemaphore"

* "Barrier"

======================================================================


Lock
====

class asyncio.Lock                            *Lock..asyncio-sync.txt*

   Implements a mutex lock for asyncio tasks.  Not thread-safe.

   An asyncio lock can be used to guarantee exclusive access to a
   shared resource.

   The preferred way to use a Lock is an "async with" statement:
>
      lock = asyncio.Lock()

      # ... later
      async with lock:
          # access shared state
<
   which is equivalent to:
>
      lock = asyncio.Lock()

      # ... later
      await lock.acquire()
      try:
          # access shared state
      finally:
          lock.release()
<
   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   coroutine acquire()                 *Lock.acquire()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Acquire the lock.

      This method waits until the lock is _unlocked_, sets it to
      _locked_ and returns "True".

      When more than one coroutine is blocked in "acquire()" waiting
      for the lock to be unlocked, only one coroutine eventually
      proceeds.

      Acquiring a lock is _fair_: the coroutine that proceeds will be
      the first coroutine that started waiting on the lock.

   release()                           *Lock.release()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Release the lock.

      When the lock is _locked_, reset it to _unlocked_ and return.

      If the lock is _unlocked_, a "RuntimeError" is raised.

   locked()                             *Lock.locked()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Return "True" if the lock is _locked_.


Event
=====

class asyncio.Event                          *Event..asyncio-sync.txt*

   An event object.  Not thread-safe.

   An asyncio event can be used to notify multiple asyncio tasks that
   some event has happened.

   An Event object manages an internal flag that can be set to _true_
   with the "set()" method and reset to _false_ with the "clear()"
   method.  The "wait()" method blocks until the flag is set to
   _true_.  The flag is set to _false_ initially.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   Example:
>
      async def waiter(event):
          print('waiting for it ...')
          await event.wait()
          print('... got it!')

      async def main():
          # Create an Event object.
          event = asyncio.Event()

          # Spawn a Task to wait until 'event' is set.
          waiter_task = asyncio.create_task(waiter(event))

          # Sleep for 1 second and set the event.
          await asyncio.sleep(1)
          event.set()

          # Wait until the waiter task is finished.
          await waiter_task

      asyncio.run(main())
<
   coroutine wait()                      *Event.wait()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Wait until the event is set.

      If the event is set, return "True" immediately. Otherwise block
      until another task calls "set()".

   set()                                  *Event.set()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Set the event.

      All tasks waiting for event to be set will be immediately
      awakened.

   clear()                              *Event.clear()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Clear (unset) the event.

      Tasks awaiting on "wait()" will now block until the "set()"
      method is called again.

   is_set()                            *Event.is_set()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Return "True" if the event is set.


Condition
=========

class asyncio.Condition(lock=None)       *Condition..asyncio-sync.txt*

   A Condition object.  Not thread-safe.

   An asyncio condition primitive can be used by a task to wait for
   some event to happen and then get exclusive access to a shared
   resource.

   In essence, a Condition object combines the functionality of an
   "Event" and a "Lock".  It is possible to have multiple Condition
   objects share one Lock, which allows coordinating exclusive access
   to a shared resource between different tasks interested in
   particular states of that shared resource.

   The optional _lock_ argument must be a "Lock" object or "None".  In
   the latter case a new Lock object is created automatically.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   The preferred way to use a Condition is an "async with" statement:
>
      cond = asyncio.Condition()

      # ... later
      async with cond:
          await cond.wait()
<
   which is equivalent to:
>
      cond = asyncio.Condition()

      # ... later
      await cond.acquire()
      try:
          await cond.wait()
      finally:
          cond.release()
<
   coroutine acquire()            *Condition.acquire()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Acquire the underlying lock.

      This method waits until the underlying lock is _unlocked_, sets
      it to _locked_ and returns "True".

   notify(n=1)                     *Condition.notify()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Wake up at most _n_ tasks (1 by default) waiting on this
      condition.  The method is no-op if no tasks are waiting.

      The lock must be acquired before this method is called and
      released shortly after.  If called with an _unlocked_ lock a
      "RuntimeError" error is raised.

   locked()                        *Condition.locked()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Return "True" if the underlying lock is acquired.

   notify_all()                *Condition.notify_all()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Wake up all tasks waiting on this condition.

      This method acts like "notify()", but wakes up all waiting
      tasks.

      The lock must be acquired before this method is called and
      released shortly after.  If called with an _unlocked_ lock a
      "RuntimeError" error is raised.

   release()                      *Condition.release()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Release the underlying lock.

      When invoked on an unlocked lock, a "RuntimeError" is raised.

   coroutine wait()                  *Condition.wait()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Wait until notified.

      If the calling task has not acquired the lock when this method
      is called, a "RuntimeError" is raised.

      This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until
      it is awakened by a "notify()" or "notify_all()" call. Once
      awakened, the Condition re-acquires its lock and this method
      returns "True".

                              *Condition.wait_for()..asyncio-sync.txt*
   coroutine wait_for(predicate)

      Wait until a predicate becomes _true_.

      The predicate must be a callable which result will be
      interpreted as a boolean value.  The final value is the return
      value.


Semaphore
=========

class asyncio.Semaphore(value=1)         *Semaphore..asyncio-sync.txt*

   A Semaphore object.  Not thread-safe.

   A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by
   each "acquire()" call and incremented by each "release()" call. The
   counter can never go below zero; when "acquire()" finds that it is
   zero, it blocks, waiting until some task calls "release()".

   The optional _value_ argument gives the initial value for the
   internal counter ("1" by default). If the given value is less than
   "0" a "ValueError" is raised.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.

   The preferred way to use a Semaphore is an "async with" statement:
>
      sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)

      # ... later
      async with sem:
          # work with shared resource
<
   which is equivalent to:
>
      sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)

      # ... later
      await sem.acquire()
      try:
          # work with shared resource
      finally:
          sem.release()
<
   coroutine acquire()            *Semaphore.acquire()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Acquire a semaphore.

      If the internal counter is greater than zero, decrement it by
      one and return "True" immediately.  If it is zero, wait until a
      "release()" is called and return "True".

   locked()                        *Semaphore.locked()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Returns "True" if semaphore can not be acquired immediately.

   release()                      *Semaphore.release()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one.
      Can wake up a task waiting to acquire the semaphore.

      Unlike "BoundedSemaphore", "Semaphore" allows making more
      "release()" calls than "acquire()" calls.


BoundedSemaphore
================

                                  *BoundedSemaphore..asyncio-sync.txt*
class asyncio.BoundedSemaphore(value=1)

   A bounded semaphore object.  Not thread-safe.

   Bounded Semaphore is a version of "Semaphore" that raises a
   "ValueError" in "release()" if it increases the internal counter
   above the initial _value_.

   Changed in version 3.10: Removed the _loop_ parameter.


Barrier
=======

class asyncio.Barrier(parties)             *Barrier..asyncio-sync.txt*

   A barrier object.  Not thread-safe.

   A barrier is a simple synchronization primitive that allows to
   block until _parties_ number of tasks are waiting on it. Tasks can
   wait on the "wait()" method and would be blocked until the
   specified number of tasks end up waiting on "wait()". At that point
   all of the waiting tasks would unblock simultaneously.

   "async with" can be used as an alternative to awaiting on "wait()".

   The barrier can be reused any number of times.

   Example:
>
      async def example_barrier():
         # barrier with 3 parties
         b = asyncio.Barrier(3)

         # create 2 new waiting tasks
         asyncio.create_task(b.wait())
         asyncio.create_task(b.wait())

         await asyncio.sleep(0)
         print(b)

         # The third .wait() call passes the barrier
         await b.wait()
         print(b)
         print("barrier passed")

         await asyncio.sleep(0)
         print(b)

      asyncio.run(example_barrier())
<
   Result of this example is:
>
      <asyncio.locks.Barrier object at 0x... [filling, waiters:2/3]>
      <asyncio.locks.Barrier object at 0x... [draining, waiters:0/3]>
      barrier passed
      <asyncio.locks.Barrier object at 0x... [filling, waiters:0/3]>
<
   New in version 3.11.

   coroutine wait()                    *Barrier.wait()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Pass the barrier. When all the tasks party to the barrier have
      called this function, they are all unblocked simultaneously.

      When a waiting or blocked task in the barrier is cancelled, this
      task exits the barrier which stays in the same state. If the
      state of the barrier is “filling”, the number of waiting task
      decreases by 1.

      The return value is an integer in the range of 0 to "parties-1",
      different for each task. This can be used to select a task to do
      some special housekeeping, e.g.:
>
         ...
         async with barrier as position:
            if position == 0:
               # Only one task prints this
               print('End of *draining phase*')
<
      This method may raise a "BrokenBarrierError" exception if the
      barrier is broken or reset while a task is waiting. It could
      raise a "CancelledError" if a task is cancelled.

   coroutine reset()                  *Barrier.reset()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Return the barrier to the default, empty state.  Any tasks
      waiting on it will receive the "BrokenBarrierError" exception.

      If a barrier is broken it may be better to just leave it and
      create a new one.

   coroutine abort()                  *Barrier.abort()..asyncio-sync.txt*

      Put the barrier into a broken state.  This causes any active or
      future calls to "wait()" to fail with the "BrokenBarrierError".
      Use this for example if one of the tasks needs to abort, to
      avoid infinite waiting tasks.

   parties                            *Barrier.parties..asyncio-sync.txt*

      The number of tasks required to pass the barrier.

   n_waiting                        *Barrier.n_waiting..asyncio-sync.txt*

      The number of tasks currently waiting in the barrier while
      filling.

   broken                              *Barrier.broken..asyncio-sync.txt*

      A boolean that is "True" if the barrier is in the broken state.

                                *BrokenBarrierError..asyncio-sync.txt*
exception asyncio.BrokenBarrierError

   This exception, a subclass of "RuntimeError", is raised when the
   "Barrier" object is reset or broken.

======================================================================

Changed in version 3.9: Acquiring a lock using "await lock" or "yield
from lock" and/or "with" statement ("with await lock", "with (yield
from lock)") was removed.  Use "async with lock" instead.
