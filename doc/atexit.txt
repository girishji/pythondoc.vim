"atexit" — Exit handlers
************************

======================================================================

The "atexit" module defines functions to register and unregister
cleanup functions.  Functions thus registered are automatically
executed upon normal interpreter termination.  "atexit" runs these
functions in the _reverse_ order in which they were registered; if you
register "A", "B", and "C", at interpreter termination time they will
be run in the order "C", "B", "A".

**Note:** The functions registered via this module are not called when
the program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python
fatal internal error is detected, or when "os._exit()" is called.

**Note:** The effect of registering or unregistering functions from
within a cleanup function is undefined.

Changed in version 3.7: When used with C-API subinterpreters,
registered functions are local to the interpreter they were registered
in.

atexit.register(func, *args, **kwargs)        *register()..atexit.txt*

   Register _func_ as a function to be executed at termination.  Any
   optional arguments that are to be passed to _func_ must be passed
   as arguments to "register()".  It is possible to register the same
   function and arguments more than once.

   At normal program termination (for instance, if "sys.exit()" is
   called or the main module’s execution completes), all functions
   registered are called in last in, first out order.  The assumption
   is that lower level modules will normally be imported before higher
   level modules and thus must be cleaned up later.

   If an exception is raised during execution of the exit handlers, a
   traceback is printed (unless "SystemExit" is raised) and the
   exception information is saved.  After all exit handlers have had a
   chance to run, the last exception to be raised is re-raised.

   This function returns _func_, which makes it possible to use it as
   a decorator.

   Warning:

     Starting new threads or calling "os.fork()" from a registered
     function can lead to race condition between the main Python
     runtime thread freeing thread states while internal "threading"
     routines or the new process try to use that state. This can lead
     to crashes rather than clean shutdown.

   Changed in version 3.12: Attempts to start a new thread or
   "os.fork()" a new process in a registered function now leads to
   "RuntimeError".

atexit.unregister(func)                     *unregister()..atexit.txt*

   Remove _func_ from the list of functions to be run at interpreter
   shutdown. "unregister()" silently does nothing if _func_ was not
   previously registered.  If _func_ has been registered more than
   once, every occurrence of that function in the "atexit" call stack
   will be removed.  Equality comparisons ("==") are used internally
   during unregistration, so function references do not need to have
   matching identities.

"atexit" Example
================

The following simple example demonstrates how a module can initialize
a counter from a file when it is imported and save the counter’s
updated value automatically when the program terminates without
relying on the application making an explicit call into this module at
termination.
>
   try:
       with open('counterfile') as infile:
           _count = int(infile.read())
   except FileNotFoundError:
       _count = 0

   def incrcounter(n):
       global _count
       _count = _count + n

   def savecounter():
       with open('counterfile', 'w') as outfile:
           outfile.write('%d' % _count)

   import atexit

   atexit.register(savecounter)
<
Positional and keyword arguments may also be passed to "register()" to
be passed along to the registered function when it is called:
>
   def goodbye(name, adjective):
       print('Goodbye %s, it was %s to meet you.' % (name, adjective))

   import atexit

   atexit.register(goodbye, 'Donny', 'nice')
   # or:
   atexit.register(goodbye, adjective='nice', name='Donny')
<
Usage as a _decorator_:
>
   import atexit

   @atexit.register
   def goodbye():
       print('You are now leaving the Python sector.')
<
This only works with functions that can be called without arguments.
