"csv" — CSV File Reading and Writing
************************************

**Source code:** Lib/csv.py

======================================================================

The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common
import and export format for spreadsheets and databases.  CSV format
was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a
standardized way in **RFC 4180**.  The lack of a well-defined standard
means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and
consumed by different applications.  These differences can make it
annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources. Still, while the
delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar
enough that it is possible to write a single module which can
efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and
writing the data from the programmer.

The "csv" module implements classes to read and write tabular data in
CSV format.  It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the
format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was
generated by Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV
format used by Excel.  Programmers can also describe the CSV formats
understood by other applications or define their own special-purpose
CSV formats.

The "csv" module’s "reader" and "writer" objects read and write
sequences.  Programmers can also read and write data in dictionary
form using the "DictReader" and "DictWriter" classes.

  **PEP 305** - CSV File API
     The Python Enhancement Proposal which proposed this addition to
     Python.


Module Contents
===============

The "csv" module defines the following functions:

                                                   *reader()..csv.txt*
csv.reader(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams)

   Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given
   _csvfile_. _csvfile_ can be any object which supports the
   _iterator_ protocol and returns a string each time its "__next__()"
   method is called — _file objects_ and list objects are both
   suitable.   If _csvfile_ is a file object, it should be opened with
   "newline=''". [1]  An optional _dialect_ parameter can be given
   which is used to define a set of parameters specific to a
   particular CSV dialect.  It may be an instance of a subclass of the
   "Dialect" class or one of the strings returned by the
   "list_dialects()" function.  The other optional _fmtparams_ keyword
   arguments can be given to override individual formatting parameters
   in the current dialect.  For full details about the dialect and
   formatting parameters, see section Dialects and Formatting
   Parameters.

   Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.
   No automatic data type conversion is performed unless the
   "QUOTE_NONNUMERIC" format option is specified (in which case
   unquoted fields are transformed into floats).

   A short usage example:
>
      >>> import csv
      >>> with open('eggs.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
      ...     spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
      ...     for row in spamreader:
      ...         print(', '.join(row))
      Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Baked Beans
      Spam, Lovely Spam, Wonderful Spam
<

                                                   *writer()..csv.txt*
csv.writer(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams)

   Return a writer object responsible for converting the user’s data
   into delimited strings on the given file-like object.  _csvfile_
   can be any object with a "write()" method.  If _csvfile_ is a file
   object, it should be opened with "newline=''" [1].  An optional
   _dialect_ parameter can be given which is used to define a set of
   parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect.  It may be an
   instance of a subclass of the "Dialect" class or one of the strings
   returned by the "list_dialects()" function.  The other optional
   _fmtparams_ keyword arguments can be given to override individual
   formatting parameters in the current dialect.  For full details
   about dialects and formatting parameters, see the Dialects and
   Formatting Parameters section. To make it as easy as possible to
   interface with modules which implement the DB API, the value "None"
   is written as the empty string.  While this isn’t a reversible
   transformation, it makes it easier to dump SQL NULL data values to
   CSV files without preprocessing the data returned from a
   "cursor.fetch*" call. All other non-string data are stringified
   with "str()" before being written.

   A short usage example:
>
      import csv
      with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
          spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ',
                                  quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
          spamwriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
          spamwriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
<

                                         *register_dialect()..csv.txt*
csv.register_dialect(name[, dialect[, **fmtparams]])

   Associate _dialect_ with _name_.  _name_ must be a string. The
   dialect can be specified either by passing a sub-class of
   "Dialect", or by _fmtparams_ keyword arguments, or both, with
   keyword arguments overriding parameters of the dialect. For full
   details about dialects and formatting parameters, see section
   Dialects and Formatting Parameters.

csv.unregister_dialect(name)           *unregister_dialect()..csv.txt*

   Delete the dialect associated with _name_ from the dialect
   registry.  An "Error" is raised if _name_ is not a registered
   dialect name.

csv.get_dialect(name)                         *get_dialect()..csv.txt*

   Return the dialect associated with _name_.  An "Error" is raised if
   _name_ is not a registered dialect name.  This function returns an
   immutable "Dialect".

csv.list_dialects()                         *list_dialects()..csv.txt*

   Return the names of all registered dialects.

csv.field_size_limit([new_limit])        *field_size_limit()..csv.txt*

   Returns the current maximum field size allowed by the parser. If
   _new_limit_ is given, this becomes the new limit.

The "csv" module defines the following classes:

                                                 *DictReader..csv.txt*
class csv.DictReader(f, fieldnames=None, restkey=None, restval=None, dialect='excel', *args, **kwds)

   Create an object that operates like a regular reader but maps the
   information in each row to a "dict" whose keys are given by the
   optional _fieldnames_ parameter.

   The _fieldnames_ parameter is a _sequence_.  If _fieldnames_ is
   omitted, the values in the first row of file _f_ will be used as
   the fieldnames.  Regardless of how the fieldnames are determined,
   the dictionary preserves their original ordering.

   If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put
   in a list and stored with the fieldname specified by _restkey_
   (which defaults to "None").  If a non-blank row has fewer fields
   than fieldnames, the missing values are filled-in with the value of
   _restval_ (which defaults to "None").

   All other optional or keyword arguments are passed to the
   underlying "reader" instance.

   If the argument passed to _fieldnames_ is an iterator, it will be
   coerced to a "list".

   Changed in version 3.6: Returned rows are now of type
   "OrderedDict".

   Changed in version 3.8: Returned rows are now of type "dict".

   A short usage example:
>
      >>> import csv
      >>> with open('names.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
      ...     reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
      ...     for row in reader:
      ...         print(row['first_name'], row['last_name'])
      ...
      Eric Idle
      John Cleese

      >>> print(row)
      {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Cleese'}
<

                                                 *DictWriter..csv.txt*
class csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames, restval='', extrasaction='raise', dialect='excel', *args, **kwds)

   Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps
   dictionaries onto output rows.  The _fieldnames_ parameter is a
   "sequence" of keys that identify the order in which values in the
   dictionary passed to the "writerow()" method are written to file
   _f_.  The optional _restval_ parameter specifies the value to be
   written if the dictionary is missing a key in _fieldnames_.  If the
   dictionary passed to the "writerow()" method contains a key not
   found in _fieldnames_, the optional _extrasaction_ parameter
   indicates what action to take. If it is set to "'raise'", the
   default value, a "ValueError" is raised. If it is set to
   "'ignore'", extra values in the dictionary are ignored. Any other
   optional or keyword arguments are passed to the underlying "writer"
   instance.

   Note that unlike the "DictReader" class, the _fieldnames_ parameter
   of the "DictWriter" class is not optional.

   If the argument passed to _fieldnames_ is an iterator, it will be
   coerced to a "list".

   A short usage example:
>
      import csv

      with open('names.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
          fieldnames = ['first_name', 'last_name']
          writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

          writer.writeheader()
          writer.writerow({'first_name': 'Baked', 'last_name': 'Beans'})
          writer.writerow({'first_name': 'Lovely', 'last_name': 'Spam'})
          writer.writerow({'first_name': 'Wonderful', 'last_name': 'Spam'})
<
class csv.Dialect                                   *Dialect..csv.txt*

   The "Dialect" class is a container class whose attributes contain
   information for how to handle doublequotes, whitespace, delimiters,
   etc. Due to the lack of a strict CSV specification, different
   applications produce subtly different CSV data.  "Dialect"
   instances define how "reader" and "writer" instances behave.

   All available "Dialect" names are returned by "list_dialects()",
   and they can be registered with specific "reader" and "writer"
   classes through their initializer ("__init__") functions like this:
>
      import csv

      with open('students.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
          writer = csv.writer(csvfile, dialect='unix')
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<
class csv.excel                                       *excel..csv.txt*

   The "excel" class defines the usual properties of an Excel-
   generated CSV file.  It is registered with the dialect name
   "'excel'".

class csv.excel_tab                               *excel_tab..csv.txt*

   The "excel_tab" class defines the usual properties of an Excel-
   generated TAB-delimited file.  It is registered with the dialect
   name "'excel-tab'".

class csv.unix_dialect                         *unix_dialect..csv.txt*

   The "unix_dialect" class defines the usual properties of a CSV file
   generated on UNIX systems, i.e. using "'\n'" as line terminator and
   quoting all fields.  It is registered with the dialect name
   "'unix'".

   New in version 3.2.

class csv.Sniffer                                   *Sniffer..csv.txt*

   The "Sniffer" class is used to deduce the format of a CSV file.

   The "Sniffer" class provides two methods:

   sniff(sample, delimiters=None)              *Sniffer.sniff()..csv.txt*

      Analyze the given _sample_ and return a "Dialect" subclass
      reflecting the parameters found.  If the optional _delimiters_
      parameter is given, it is interpreted as a string containing
      possible valid delimiter characters.

   has_header(sample)                     *Sniffer.has_header()..csv.txt*

      Analyze the sample text (presumed to be in CSV format) and
      return "True" if the first row appears to be a series of column
      headers. Inspecting each column, one of two key criteria will be
      considered to estimate if the sample contains a header:

         * the second through n-th rows contain numeric values

         * the second through n-th rows contain strings where at least
           one value’s length differs from that of the putative header
           of that column.

      Twenty rows after the first row are sampled; if more than half
      of columns + rows meet the criteria, "True" is returned.

   Note:

     This method is a rough heuristic and may produce both false
     positives and negatives.

An example for "Sniffer" use:
>
   with open('example.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
       dialect = csv.Sniffer().sniff(csvfile.read(1024))
       csvfile.seek(0)
       reader = csv.reader(csvfile, dialect)
       # ... process CSV file contents here ...
<
The "csv" module defines the following constants:

csv.QUOTE_ALL                                     *QUOTE_ALL..csv.txt*

   Instructs "writer" objects to quote all fields.

csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL                             *QUOTE_MINIMAL..csv.txt*

   Instructs "writer" objects to only quote those fields which contain
   special characters such as _delimiter_, _quotechar_ or any of the
   characters in _lineterminator_.

csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC                       *QUOTE_NONNUMERIC..csv.txt*

   Instructs "writer" objects to quote all non-numeric fields.

   Instructs "reader" objects to convert all non-quoted fields to type
   _float_.

csv.QUOTE_NONE                                   *QUOTE_NONE..csv.txt*

   Instructs "writer" objects to never quote fields.  When the current
   _delimiter_ occurs in output data it is preceded by the current
   _escapechar_ character.  If _escapechar_ is not set, the writer
   will raise "Error" if any characters that require escaping are
   encountered.

   Instructs "reader" objects to perform no special processing of
   quote characters.

csv.QUOTE_NOTNULL                             *QUOTE_NOTNULL..csv.txt*

   Instructs "writer" objects to quote all fields which are not
   "None".  This is similar to "QUOTE_ALL", except that if a field
   value is "None" an empty (unquoted) string is written.

   Instructs "reader" objects to interpret an empty (unquoted) field
   as None and to otherwise behave as "QUOTE_ALL".

csv.QUOTE_STRINGS                             *QUOTE_STRINGS..csv.txt*

   Instructs "writer" objects to always place quotes around fields
   which are strings.  This is similar to "QUOTE_NONNUMERIC", except
   that if a field value is "None" an empty (unquoted) string is
   written.

   Instructs "reader" objects to interpret an empty (unquoted) string
   as "None" and to otherwise behave as "QUOTE_NONNUMERIC".

The "csv" module defines the following exception:

exception csv.Error                                   *Error..csv.txt*

   Raised by any of the functions when an error is detected.


Dialects and Formatting Parameters
==================================

To make it easier to specify the format of input and output records,
specific formatting parameters are grouped together into dialects.  A
dialect is a subclass of the "Dialect" class having a set of specific
methods and a single "validate()" method.  When creating "reader" or
"writer" objects, the programmer can specify a string or a subclass of
the "Dialect" class as the dialect parameter.  In addition to, or
instead of, the _dialect_ parameter, the programmer can also specify
individual formatting parameters, which have the same names as the
attributes defined below for the "Dialect" class.

Dialects support the following attributes:

Dialect.delimiter                         *Dialect.delimiter..csv.txt*

   A one-character string used to separate fields.  It defaults to
   "','".

Dialect.doublequote                     *Dialect.doublequote..csv.txt*

   Controls how instances of _quotechar_ appearing inside a field
   should themselves be quoted.  When "True", the character is
   doubled. When "False", the _escapechar_ is used as a prefix to the
   _quotechar_.  It defaults to "True".

   On output, if _doublequote_ is "False" and no _escapechar_ is set,
   "Error" is raised if a _quotechar_ is found in a field.

Dialect.escapechar                       *Dialect.escapechar..csv.txt*

   A one-character string used by the writer to escape the _delimiter_
   if _quoting_ is set to "QUOTE_NONE" and the _quotechar_ if
   _doublequote_ is "False". On reading, the _escapechar_ removes any
   special meaning from the following character. It defaults to
   "None", which disables escaping.

   Changed in version 3.11: An empty _escapechar_ is not allowed.

Dialect.lineterminator               *Dialect.lineterminator..csv.txt*

   The string used to terminate lines produced by the "writer". It
   defaults to "'\r\n'".

   Note:

     The "reader" is hard-coded to recognise either "'\r'" or "'\n'"
     as end-of-line, and ignores _lineterminator_. This behavior may
     change in the future.

Dialect.quotechar                         *Dialect.quotechar..csv.txt*

   A one-character string used to quote fields containing special
   characters, such as the _delimiter_ or _quotechar_, or which
   contain new-line characters.  It defaults to "'"'".

   Changed in version 3.11: An empty _quotechar_ is not allowed.

Dialect.quoting                             *Dialect.quoting..csv.txt*

   Controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and
   recognised by the reader.  It can take on any of the "QUOTE_*"
   constants (see section Module Contents) and defaults to
   "QUOTE_MINIMAL".

Dialect.skipinitialspace           *Dialect.skipinitialspace..csv.txt*

   When "True", spaces immediately following the _delimiter_ are
   ignored. The default is "False".

Dialect.strict                               *Dialect.strict..csv.txt*

   When "True", raise exception "Error" on bad CSV input. The default
   is "False".


Reader Objects
==============

Reader objects ("DictReader" instances and objects returned by the
"reader()" function) have the following public methods:

csvreader.__next__()                   *csvreader.__next__()..csv.txt*

   Return the next row of the reader’s iterable object as a list (if
   the object was returned from "reader()") or a dict (if it is a
   "DictReader" instance), parsed according to the current "Dialect".
   Usually you should call this as "next(reader)".

Reader objects have the following public attributes:

csvreader.dialect                         *csvreader.dialect..csv.txt*

   A read-only description of the dialect in use by the parser.

csvreader.line_num                       *csvreader.line_num..csv.txt*

   The number of lines read from the source iterator. This is not the
   same as the number of records returned, as records can span
   multiple lines.

DictReader objects have the following public attribute:

DictReader.fieldnames                 *DictReader.fieldnames..csv.txt*

   If not passed as a parameter when creating the object, this
   attribute is initialized upon first access or when the first record
   is read from the file.


Writer Objects
==============

"Writer" objects ("DictWriter" instances and objects returned by the
"writer()" function) have the following public methods.  A _row_ must
be an iterable of strings or numbers for "Writer" objects and a
dictionary mapping fieldnames to strings or numbers (by passing them
through "str()" first) for "DictWriter" objects.  Note that complex
numbers are written out surrounded by parens. This may cause some
problems for other programs which read CSV files (assuming they
support complex numbers at all).

csvwriter.writerow(row)                *csvwriter.writerow()..csv.txt*

   Write the _row_ parameter to the writer’s file object, formatted
   according to the current "Dialect". Return the return value of the
   call to the _write_ method of the underlying file object.

   Changed in version 3.5: Added support of arbitrary iterables.

csvwriter.writerows(rows)             *csvwriter.writerows()..csv.txt*

   Write all elements in _rows_ (an iterable of _row_ objects as
   described above) to the writer’s file object, formatted according
   to the current dialect.

Writer objects have the following public attribute:

csvwriter.dialect                         *csvwriter.dialect..csv.txt*

   A read-only description of the dialect in use by the writer.

DictWriter objects have the following public method:

DictWriter.writeheader()           *DictWriter.writeheader()..csv.txt*

   Write a row with the field names (as specified in the constructor)
   to the writer’s file object, formatted according to the current
   dialect. Return the return value of the "csvwriter.writerow()" call
   used internally.

   New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.8: "writeheader()" now also returns the value
   returned by the "csvwriter.writerow()" method it uses internally.


Examples
========

The simplest example of reading a CSV file:
>
   import csv
   with open('some.csv', newline='') as f:
       reader = csv.reader(f)
       for row in reader:
           print(row)
<
Reading a file with an alternate format:
>
   import csv
   with open('passwd', newline='') as f:
       reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=':', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)
       for row in reader:
           print(row)
<
The corresponding simplest possible writing example is:
>
   import csv
   with open('some.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
       writer = csv.writer(f)
       writer.writerows(someiterable)
<
Since "open()" is used to open a CSV file for reading, the file will
by default be decoded into unicode using the system default encoding
(see "locale.getencoding()").  To decode a file using a different
encoding, use the "encoding" argument of open:
>
   import csv
   with open('some.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       reader = csv.reader(f)
       for row in reader:
           print(row)
<
The same applies to writing in something other than the system default
encoding: specify the encoding argument when opening the output file.

Registering a new dialect:
>
   import csv
   csv.register_dialect('unixpwd', delimiter=':', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)
   with open('passwd', newline='') as f:
       reader = csv.reader(f, 'unixpwd')
<
A slightly more advanced use of the reader — catching and reporting
errors:
>
   import csv, sys
   filename = 'some.csv'
   with open(filename, newline='') as f:
       reader = csv.reader(f)
       try:
           for row in reader:
               print(row)
       except csv.Error as e:
           sys.exit('file {}, line {}: {}'.format(filename, reader.line_num, e))
<
And while the module doesn’t directly support parsing strings, it can
easily be done:
>
   import csv
   for row in csv.reader(['one,two,three']):
       print(row)
<
-[ Footnotes ]-

[1] If "newline=''" is not specified, newlines embedded inside quoted
    fields will not be interpreted correctly, and on platforms that
    use "\r\n" linendings on write an extra "\r" will be added.  It
    should always be safe to specify "newline=''", since the csv
    module does its own (_universal_) newline handling.
