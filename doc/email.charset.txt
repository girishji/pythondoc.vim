"email.charset": Representing character sets
********************************************

**Source code:** Lib/email/charset.py

======================================================================

This module is part of the legacy ("Compat32") email API.  In the new
API only the aliases table is used.

The remaining text in this section is the original documentation of
the module.

This module provides a class "Charset" for representing character sets
and character set conversions in email messages, as well as a
character set registry and several convenience methods for
manipulating this registry. Instances of "Charset" are used in several
other modules within the "email" package.

Import this class from the "email.charset" module.

                                          *Charset..email.charset.txt*
class email.charset.Charset(input_charset=DEFAULT_CHARSET)

   Map character sets to their email properties.

   This class provides information about the requirements imposed on
   email for a specific character set.  It also provides convenience
   routines for converting between character sets, given the
   availability of the applicable codecs.  Given a character set, it
   will do its best to provide information on how to use that
   character set in an email message in an RFC-compliant way.

   Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or
   base64 when used in email headers or bodies.  Certain character
   sets must be converted outright, and are not allowed in email.

   Optional _input_charset_ is as described below; it is always
   coerced to lower case.  After being alias normalized it is also
   used as a lookup into the registry of character sets to find out
   the header encoding, body encoding, and output conversion codec to
   be used for the character set.  For example, if _input_charset_ is
   "iso-8859-1", then headers and bodies will be encoded using quoted-
   printable and no output conversion codec is necessary.  If
   _input_charset_ is "euc-jp", then headers will be encoded with
   base64, bodies will not be encoded, but output text will be
   converted from the "euc-jp" character set to the "iso-2022-jp"
   character set.

   "Charset" instances have the following data attributes:

   input_charset               *Charset.input_charset..email.charset.txt*

      The initial character set specified.  Common aliases are
      converted to their _official_ email names (e.g. "latin_1" is
      converted to "iso-8859-1").  Defaults to 7-bit "us-ascii".

   header_encoding           *Charset.header_encoding..email.charset.txt*

      If the character set must be encoded before it can be used in an
      email header, this attribute will be set to "charset.QP" (for
      quoted-printable), "charset.BASE64" (for base64 encoding), or
      "charset.SHORTEST" for the shortest of QP or BASE64 encoding.
      Otherwise, it will be "None".

   body_encoding               *Charset.body_encoding..email.charset.txt*

      Same as _header_encoding_, but describes the encoding for the
      mail message’s body, which indeed may be different than the
      header encoding. "charset.SHORTEST" is not allowed for
      _body_encoding_.

   output_charset             *Charset.output_charset..email.charset.txt*

      Some character sets must be converted before they can be used in
      email headers or bodies.  If the _input_charset_ is one of them,
      this attribute will contain the name of the character set output
      will be converted to. Otherwise, it will be "None".

   input_codec                   *Charset.input_codec..email.charset.txt*

      The name of the Python codec used to convert the _input_charset_
      to Unicode.  If no conversion codec is necessary, this attribute
      will be "None".

   output_codec                 *Charset.output_codec..email.charset.txt*

      The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode to the
      _output_charset_.  If no conversion codec is necessary, this
      attribute will have the same value as the _input_codec_.

   "Charset" instances also have the following methods:

   get_body_encoding()   *Charset.get_body_encoding()..email.charset.txt*

      Return the content transfer encoding used for body encoding.

      This is either the string "quoted-printable" or "base64"
      depending on the encoding used, or it is a function, in which
      case you should call the function with a single argument, the
      Message object being encoded.  The function should then set the
      _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header itself to whatever is
      appropriate.

      Returns the string "quoted-printable" if _body_encoding_ is
      "QP", returns the string "base64" if _body_encoding_ is
      "BASE64", and returns the string "7bit" otherwise.

                     *Charset.get_output_charset()..email.charset.txt*
   get_output_charset()

      Return the output character set.

      This is the _output_charset_ attribute if that is not "None",
      otherwise it is _input_charset_.

   header_encode(string)     *Charset.header_encode()..email.charset.txt*

      Header-encode the string _string_.

      The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based
      on the _header_encoding_ attribute.

                    *Charset.header_encode_lines()..email.charset.txt*
   header_encode_lines(string, maxlengths)

      Header-encode a _string_ by converting it first to bytes.

      This is similar to "header_encode()" except that the string is
      fit into maximum line lengths as given by the argument
      _maxlengths_, which must be an iterator: each element returned
      from this iterator will provide the next maximum line length.

   body_encode(string)         *Charset.body_encode()..email.charset.txt*

      Body-encode the string _string_.

      The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based
      on the _body_encoding_ attribute.

   The "Charset" class also provides a number of methods to support
   standard operations and built-in functions.

   __str__()                       *Charset.__str__()..email.charset.txt*

      Returns _input_charset_ as a string coerced to lower case.
      "__repr__()" is an alias for "__str__()".

   __eq__(other)                    *Charset.__eq__()..email.charset.txt*

      This method allows you to compare two "Charset" instances for
      equality.

   __ne__(other)                    *Charset.__ne__()..email.charset.txt*

      This method allows you to compare two "Charset" instances for
      inequality.

The "email.charset" module also provides the following functions for
adding new entries to the global character set, alias, and codec
registries:

                                    *add_charset()..email.charset.txt*
email.charset.add_charset(charset, header_enc=None, body_enc=None, output_charset=None)

   Add character properties to the global registry.

   _charset_ is the input character set, and must be the canonical
   name of a character set.

   Optional _header_enc_ and _body_enc_ is either "charset.QP" for
   quoted-printable, "charset.BASE64" for base64 encoding,
   "charset.SHORTEST" for the shortest of quoted-printable or base64
   encoding, or "None" for no encoding.  "SHORTEST" is only valid for
   _header_enc_. The default is "None" for no encoding.

   Optional _output_charset_ is the character set that the output
   should be in. Conversions will proceed from input charset, to
   Unicode, to the output charset when the method "Charset.convert()"
   is called.  The default is to output in the same character set as
   the input.

   Both _input_charset_ and _output_charset_ must have Unicode codec
   entries in the module’s character set-to-codec mapping; use
   "add_codec()" to add codecs the module does not know about.  See
   the "codecs" module’s documentation for more information.

   The global character set registry is kept in the module global
   dictionary "CHARSETS".

                                      *add_alias()..email.charset.txt*
email.charset.add_alias(alias, canonical)

   Add a character set alias.  _alias_ is the alias name, e.g.
   "latin-1". _canonical_ is the character set’s canonical name, e.g.
   "iso-8859-1".

   The global charset alias registry is kept in the module global
   dictionary "ALIASES".

                                      *add_codec()..email.charset.txt*
email.charset.add_codec(charset, codecname)

   Add a codec that map characters in the given character set to and
   from Unicode.

   _charset_ is the canonical name of a character set. _codecname_ is
   the name of a Python codec, as appropriate for the second argument
   to the "str"’s "encode()" method.
