"email.message.Message": Representing an email message using the "compat32" API
*******************************************************************************

The "Message" class is very similar to the "EmailMessage" class,
without the methods added by that class, and with the default behavior
of certain other methods being slightly different.  We also document
here some methods that, while supported by the "EmailMessage" class,
are not recommended unless you are dealing with legacy code.

The philosophy and structure of the two classes is otherwise the same.

This document describes the behavior under the default (for "Message")
policy "Compat32".  If you are going to use another policy, you should
be using the "EmailMessage" class instead.

An email message consists of _headers_ and a _payload_.  Headers must
be **RFC 5322** style names and values, where the field name and value
are separated by a colon.  The colon is not part of either the field
name or the field value.  The payload may be a simple text message, or
a binary object, or a structured sequence of sub-messages each with
their own set of headers and their own payload.  The latter type of
payload is indicated by the message having a MIME type such as
_multipart/*_ or _message/rfc822_.

The conceptual model provided by a "Message" object is that of an
ordered dictionary of headers with additional methods for accessing
both specialized information from the headers, for accessing the
payload, for generating a serialized version of the message, and for
recursively walking over the object tree.  Note that duplicate headers
are supported but special methods must be used to access them.

The "Message" pseudo-dictionary is indexed by the header names, which
must be ASCII values.  The values of the dictionary are strings that
are supposed to contain only ASCII characters; there is some special
handling for non-ASCII input, but it doesn’t always produce the
correct results.  Headers are stored and returned in case-preserving
form, but field names are matched case-insensitively.  There may also
be a single envelope header, also known as the _Unix-From_ header or
the "From_" header.  The _payload_ is either a string or bytes, in the
case of simple message objects, or a list of "Message" objects, for
MIME container documents (e.g. _multipart/*_ and _message/rfc822_).

Here are the methods of the "Message" class:

                                 *Message..email.compat32-message.txt*
class email.message.Message(policy=compat32)

   If _policy_ is specified (it must be an instance of a "policy"
   class) use the rules it specifies to update and serialize the
   representation of the message.  If _policy_ is not set, use the
   "compat32" policy, which maintains backward compatibility with the
   Python 3.2 version of the email package.  For more information see
   the "policy" documentation.

   Changed in version 3.3: The _policy_ keyword argument was added.

                     *Message.as_string()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   as_string(unixfrom=False, maxheaderlen=0, policy=None)

      Return the entire message flattened as a string.  When optional
      _unixfrom_ is true, the envelope header is included in the
      returned string. _unixfrom_ defaults to "False".  For backward
      compatibility reasons, _maxheaderlen_ defaults to "0", so if you
      want a different value you must override it explicitly (the
      value specified for _max_line_length_ in the policy will be
      ignored by this method).  The _policy_ argument may be used to
      override the default policy obtained from the message instance.
      This can be used to control some of the formatting produced by
      the method, since the specified _policy_ will be passed to the
      "Generator".

      Flattening the message may trigger changes to the "Message" if
      defaults need to be filled in to complete the transformation to
      a string (for example, MIME boundaries may be generated or
      modified).

      Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not
      always format the message the way you want.  For example, by
      default it does not do the mangling of lines that begin with
      "From" that is required by the Unix mbox format.  For more
      flexibility, instantiate a "Generator" instance and use its
      "flatten()" method directly.  For example:
>
         from io import StringIO
         from email.generator import Generator
         fp = StringIO()
         g = Generator(fp, mangle_from_=True, maxheaderlen=60)
         g.flatten(msg)
         text = fp.getvalue()
<
      If the message object contains binary data that is not encoded
      according to RFC standards, the non-compliant data will be
      replaced by unicode “unknown character” code points.  (See also
      "as_bytes()" and "BytesGenerator".)

      Changed in version 3.4: the _policy_ keyword argument was added.

   __str__()              *Message.__str__()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Equivalent to "as_string()".  Allows "str(msg)" to produce a
      string containing the formatted message.

                      *Message.as_bytes()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   as_bytes(unixfrom=False, policy=None)

      Return the entire message flattened as a bytes object.  When
      optional _unixfrom_ is true, the envelope header is included in
      the returned string.  _unixfrom_ defaults to "False".  The
      _policy_ argument may be used to override the default policy
      obtained from the message instance. This can be used to control
      some of the formatting produced by the method, since the
      specified _policy_ will be passed to the "BytesGenerator".

      Flattening the message may trigger changes to the "Message" if
      defaults need to be filled in to complete the transformation to
      a string (for example, MIME boundaries may be generated or
      modified).

      Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not
      always format the message the way you want.  For example, by
      default it does not do the mangling of lines that begin with
      "From" that is required by the Unix mbox format.  For more
      flexibility, instantiate a "BytesGenerator" instance and use its
      "flatten()" method directly. For example:
>
         from io import BytesIO
         from email.generator import BytesGenerator
         fp = BytesIO()
         g = BytesGenerator(fp, mangle_from_=True, maxheaderlen=60)
         g.flatten(msg)
         text = fp.getvalue()
<
      New in version 3.4.

   __bytes__()          *Message.__bytes__()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Equivalent to "as_bytes()".  Allows "bytes(msg)" to produce a
      bytes object containing the formatted message.

      New in version 3.4.

   is_multipart()    *Message.is_multipart()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return "True" if the message’s payload is a list of
      sub-"Message" objects, otherwise return "False".  When
      "is_multipart()" returns "False", the payload should be a string
      object (which might be a CTE encoded binary payload).  (Note
      that "is_multipart()" returning "True" does not necessarily mean
      that “msg.get_content_maintype() == ‘multipart’” will return the
      "True". For example, "is_multipart" will return "True" when the
      "Message" is of type "message/rfc822".)

                  *Message.set_unixfrom()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_unixfrom(unixfrom)

      Set the message’s envelope header to _unixfrom_, which should be
      a string.

   get_unixfrom()    *Message.get_unixfrom()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return the message’s envelope header.  Defaults to "None" if the
      envelope header was never set.

   attach(payload)         *Message.attach()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Add the given _payload_ to the current payload, which must be
      "None" or a list of "Message" objects before the call. After the
      call, the payload will always be a list of "Message" objects.
      If you want to set the payload to a scalar object (e.g. a
      string), use "set_payload()" instead.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by "set_content()" and the related
      "make" and "add" methods.

                   *Message.get_payload()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_payload(i=None, decode=False)

      Return the current payload, which will be a list of "Message"
      objects when "is_multipart()" is "True", or a string when
      "is_multipart()" is "False".  If the payload is a list and you
      mutate the list object, you modify the message’s payload in
      place.

      With optional argument _i_, "get_payload()" will return the
      _i_-th element of the payload, counting from zero, if
      "is_multipart()" is "True".  An "IndexError" will be raised if
      _i_ is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of
      items in the payload.  If the payload is a string (i.e.
      "is_multipart()" is "False") and _i_ is given, a "TypeError" is
      raised.

      Optional _decode_ is a flag indicating whether the payload
      should be decoded or not, according to the _Content-Transfer-
      Encoding_ header. When "True" and the message is not a
      multipart, the payload will be decoded if this header’s value is
      "quoted-printable" or "base64". If some other encoding is used,
      or _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header is missing, the payload is
      returned as-is (undecoded).  In all cases the returned value is
      binary data.  If the message is a multipart and the _decode_
      flag is "True", then "None" is returned.  If the payload is
      base64 and it was not perfectly formed (missing padding,
      characters outside the base64 alphabet), then an appropriate
      defect will be added to the message’s defect property
      ("InvalidBase64PaddingDefect" or
      "InvalidBase64CharactersDefect", respectively).

      When _decode_ is "False" (the default) the body is returned as a
      string without decoding the _Content-Transfer-Encoding_.
      However, for a _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ of 8bit, an attempt
      is made to decode the original bytes using the "charset"
      specified by the _Content-Type_ header, using the "replace"
      error handler. If no "charset" is specified, or if the "charset"
      given is not recognized by the email package, the body is
      decoded using the default ASCII charset.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by "get_content()" and "iter_parts()".

                   *Message.set_payload()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_payload(payload, charset=None)

      Set the entire message object’s payload to _payload_.  It is the
      client’s responsibility to ensure the payload invariants.
      Optional _charset_ sets the message’s default character set; see
      "set_charset()" for details.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by "set_content()".

                   *Message.set_charset()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_charset(charset)

      Set the character set of the payload to _charset_, which can
      either be a "Charset" instance (see "email.charset"), a string
      naming a character set, or "None".  If it is a string, it will
      be converted to a "Charset" instance.  If _charset_ is "None",
      the "charset" parameter will be removed from the _Content-Type_
      header (the message will not be otherwise modified).  Anything
      else will generate a "TypeError".

      If there is no existing _MIME-Version_ header one will be added.
      If there is no existing _Content-Type_ header, one will be added
      with a value of _text/plain_.  Whether the _Content-Type_ header
      already exists or not, its "charset" parameter will be set to
      _charset.output_charset_.   If _charset.input_charset_ and
      _charset.output_charset_ differ, the payload will be re-encoded
      to the _output_charset_.  If there is no existing _Content-
      Transfer-Encoding_ header, then the payload will be transfer-
      encoded, if needed, using the specified "Charset", and a header
      with the appropriate value will be added.  If a _Content-
      Transfer-Encoding_ header already exists, the payload is assumed
      to already be correctly encoded using that _Content-Transfer-
      Encoding_ and is not modified.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by the _charset_ parameter of the
      "email.emailmessage.EmailMessage.set_content()" method.

   get_charset()      *Message.get_charset()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return the "Charset" instance associated with the message’s
      payload.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class it always
      returns "None".

   The following methods implement a mapping-like interface for
   accessing the message’s **RFC 2822** headers.  Note that there are
   some semantic differences between these methods and a normal
   mapping (i.e. dictionary) interface.  For example, in a dictionary
   there are no duplicate keys, but here there may be duplicate
   message headers.  Also, in dictionaries there is no guaranteed
   order to the keys returned by "keys()", but in a "Message" object,
   headers are always returned in the order they appeared in the
   original message, or were added to the message later.  Any header
   deleted and then re-added are always appended to the end of the
   header list.

   These semantic differences are intentional and are biased toward
   maximal convenience.

   Note that in all cases, any envelope header present in the message
   is not included in the mapping interface.

   In a model generated from bytes, any header values that (in
   contravention of the RFCs) contain non-ASCII bytes will, when
   retrieved through this interface, be represented as "Header"
   objects with a charset of "unknown-8bit".

   __len__()              *Message.__len__()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return the total number of headers, including duplicates.

                  *Message.__contains__()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   __contains__(name)

      Return "True" if the message object has a field named _name_.
      Matching is done case-insensitively and _name_ should not
      include the trailing colon. Used for the "in" operator, e.g.:
>
         if 'message-id' in myMessage:
            print('Message-ID:', myMessage['message-id'])
<

                   *Message.__getitem__()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   __getitem__(name)

      Return the value of the named header field.  _name_ should not
      include the colon field separator.  If the header is missing,
      "None" is returned; a "KeyError" is never raised.

      Note that if the named field appears more than once in the
      message’s headers, exactly which of those field values will be
      returned is undefined.  Use the "get_all()" method to get the
      values of all the extant named headers.

                   *Message.__setitem__()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   __setitem__(name, val)

      Add a header to the message with field name _name_ and value
      _val_.  The field is appended to the end of the message’s
      existing fields.

      Note that this does _not_ overwrite or delete any existing
      header with the same name.  If you want to ensure that the new
      header is the only one present in the message with field name
      _name_, delete the field first, e.g.:
>
         del msg['subject']
         msg['subject'] = 'Python roolz!'
<

                   *Message.__delitem__()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   __delitem__(name)

      Delete all occurrences of the field with name _name_ from the
      message’s headers.  No exception is raised if the named field
      isn’t present in the headers.

   keys()                    *Message.keys()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return a list of all the message’s header field names.

   values()                *Message.values()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return a list of all the message’s field values.

   items()                  *Message.items()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return a list of 2-tuples containing all the message’s field
      headers and values.

   get(name, failobj=None)    *Message.get()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      Return the value of the named header field.  This is identical
      to "__getitem__()" except that optional _failobj_ is returned if
      the named header is missing (defaults to "None").

   Here are some additional useful methods:

                       *Message.get_all()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_all(name, failobj=None)

      Return a list of all the values for the field named _name_. If
      there are no such named headers in the message, _failobj_ is
      returned (defaults to "None").

                    *Message.add_header()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   add_header(_name, _value, **_params)

      Extended header setting.  This method is similar to
      "__setitem__()" except that additional header parameters can be
      provided as keyword arguments.  __name_ is the header field to
      add and __value_ is the _primary_ value for the header.

      For each item in the keyword argument dictionary __params_, the
      key is taken as the parameter name, with underscores converted
      to dashes (since dashes are illegal in Python identifiers).
      Normally, the parameter will be added as "key="value"" unless
      the value is "None", in which case only the key will be added.
      If the value contains non-ASCII characters, it can be specified
      as a three tuple in the format "(CHARSET, LANGUAGE, VALUE)",
      where "CHARSET" is a string naming the charset to be used to
      encode the value, "LANGUAGE" can usually be set to "None" or the
      empty string (see **RFC 2231** for other possibilities), and
      "VALUE" is the string value containing non-ASCII code points.
      If a three tuple is not passed and the value contains non-ASCII
      characters, it is automatically encoded in **RFC 2231** format
      using a "CHARSET" of "utf-8" and a "LANGUAGE" of "None".

      Here’s an example:
>
         msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')
<
      This will add a header that looks like
>
         Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bud.gif"
<
      An example with non-ASCII characters:
>
         msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment',
                        filename=('iso-8859-1', '', 'Fußballer.ppt'))
<
      Which produces
>
         Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*="iso-8859-1''Fu%DFballer.ppt"
<

                *Message.replace_header()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   replace_header(_name, _value)

      Replace a header.  Replace the first header found in the message
      that matches __name_, retaining header order and field name
      case.  If no matching header was found, a "KeyError" is raised.

              *Message.get_content_type()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_content_type()

      Return the message’s content type.  The returned string is
      coerced to lower case of the form _maintype/subtype_.  If there
      was no _Content-Type_ header in the message the default type as
      given by "get_default_type()" will be returned.  Since according
      to **RFC 2045**, messages always have a default type,
      "get_content_type()" will always return a value.

      **RFC 2045** defines a message’s default type to be _text/plain_
      unless it appears inside a _multipart/digest_ container, in
      which case it would be _message/rfc822_.  If the _Content-Type_
      header has an invalid type specification, **RFC 2045** mandates
      that the default type be _text/plain_.

          *Message.get_content_maintype()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_content_maintype()

      Return the message’s main content type.  This is the _maintype_
      part of the string returned by "get_content_type()".

           *Message.get_content_subtype()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_content_subtype()

      Return the message’s sub-content type.  This is the _subtype_
      part of the string returned by "get_content_type()".

              *Message.get_default_type()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_default_type()

      Return the default content type.  Most messages have a default
      content type of _text/plain_, except for messages that are
      subparts of _multipart/digest_ containers.  Such subparts have a
      default content type of _message/rfc822_.

              *Message.set_default_type()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_default_type(ctype)

      Set the default content type.  _ctype_ should either be
      _text/plain_ or _message/rfc822_, although this is not enforced.
      The default content type is not stored in the _Content-Type_
      header.

                    *Message.get_params()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_params(failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)

      Return the message’s _Content-Type_ parameters, as a list. The
      elements of the returned list are 2-tuples of key/value pairs,
      as split on the "'='" sign.  The left hand side of the "'='" is
      the key, while the right hand side is the value.  If there is no
      "'='" sign in the parameter the value is the empty string,
      otherwise the value is as described in "get_param()" and is
      unquoted if optional _unquote_ is "True" (the default).

      Optional _failobj_ is the object to return if there is no
      _Content-Type_ header.  Optional _header_ is the header to
      search instead of _Content-Type_.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by the _params_ property of the
      individual header objects returned by the header access methods.

                     *Message.get_param()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_param(param, failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)

      Return the value of the _Content-Type_ header’s parameter
      _param_ as a string.  If the message has no _Content-Type_
      header or if there is no such parameter, then _failobj_ is
      returned (defaults to "None").

      Optional _header_ if given, specifies the message header to use
      instead of _Content-Type_.

      Parameter keys are always compared case insensitively.  The
      return value can either be a string, or a 3-tuple if the
      parameter was **RFC 2231** encoded.  When it’s a 3-tuple, the
      elements of the value are of the form "(CHARSET, LANGUAGE,
      VALUE)".  Note that both "CHARSET" and "LANGUAGE" can be "None",
      in which case you should consider "VALUE" to be encoded in the
      "us-ascii" charset.  You can usually ignore "LANGUAGE".

      If your application doesn’t care whether the parameter was
      encoded as in **RFC 2231**, you can collapse the parameter value
      by calling "email.utils.collapse_rfc2231_value()", passing in
      the return value from "get_param()".  This will return a
      suitably decoded Unicode string when the value is a tuple, or
      the original string unquoted if it isn’t.  For example:
>
         rawparam = msg.get_param('foo')
         param = email.utils.collapse_rfc2231_value(rawparam)
<
      In any case, the parameter value (either the returned string, or
      the "VALUE" item in the 3-tuple) is always unquoted, unless
      _unquote_ is set to "False".

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by the _params_ property of the
      individual header objects returned by the header access methods.

                     *Message.set_param()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_param(param, value, header='Content-Type', requote=True, charset=None, language='', replace=False)

      Set a parameter in the _Content-Type_ header.  If the parameter
      already exists in the header, its value will be replaced with
      _value_.  If the _Content-Type_ header as not yet been defined
      for this message, it will be set to _text/plain_ and the new
      parameter value will be appended as per **RFC 2045**.

      Optional _header_ specifies an alternative header to _Content-
      Type_, and all parameters will be quoted as necessary unless
      optional _requote_ is "False" (the default is "True").

      If optional _charset_ is specified, the parameter will be
      encoded according to **RFC 2231**. Optional _language_ specifies
      the RFC 2231 language, defaulting to the empty string.  Both
      _charset_ and _language_ should be strings.

      If _replace_ is "False" (the default) the header is moved to the
      end of the list of headers.  If _replace_ is "True", the header
      will be updated in place.

      Changed in version 3.4: "replace" keyword was added.

                     *Message.del_param()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   del_param(param, header='content-type', requote=True)

      Remove the given parameter completely from the _Content-Type_
      header.  The header will be re-written in place without the
      parameter or its value.  All values will be quoted as necessary
      unless _requote_ is "False" (the default is "True").  Optional
      _header_ specifies an alternative to _Content-Type_.

                      *Message.set_type()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_type(type, header='Content-Type', requote=True)

      Set the main type and subtype for the _Content-Type_ header.
      _type_ must be a string in the form _maintype/subtype_,
      otherwise a "ValueError" is raised.

      This method replaces the _Content-Type_ header, keeping all the
      parameters in place.  If _requote_ is "False", this leaves the
      existing header’s quoting as is, otherwise the parameters will
      be quoted (the default).

      An alternative header can be specified in the _header_ argument.
      When the _Content-Type_ header is set a _MIME-Version_ header is
      also added.

      This is a legacy method.  On the "EmailMessage" class its
      functionality is replaced by the "make_" and "add_" methods.

                  *Message.get_filename()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_filename(failobj=None)

      Return the value of the "filename" parameter of the _Content-
      Disposition_ header of the message.  If the header does not have
      a "filename" parameter, this method falls back to looking for
      the "name" parameter on the _Content-Type_ header.  If neither
      is found, or the header is missing, then _failobj_ is returned.
      The returned string will always be unquoted as per
      "email.utils.unquote()".

                  *Message.get_boundary()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_boundary(failobj=None)

      Return the value of the "boundary" parameter of the _Content-
      Type_ header of the message, or _failobj_ if either the header
      is missing, or has no "boundary" parameter.  The returned string
      will always be unquoted as per "email.utils.unquote()".

                  *Message.set_boundary()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   set_boundary(boundary)

      Set the "boundary" parameter of the _Content-Type_ header to
      _boundary_.  "set_boundary()" will always quote _boundary_ if
      necessary.  A "HeaderParseError" is raised if the message object
      has no _Content-Type_ header.

      Note that using this method is subtly different than deleting
      the old _Content-Type_ header and adding a new one with the new
      boundary via "add_header()", because "set_boundary()" preserves
      the order of the _Content-Type_ header in the list of headers.
      However, it does _not_ preserve any continuation lines which may
      have been present in the original _Content-Type_ header.

           *Message.get_content_charset()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_content_charset(failobj=None)

      Return the "charset" parameter of the _Content-Type_ header,
      coerced to lower case.  If there is no _Content-Type_ header, or
      if that header has no "charset" parameter, _failobj_ is
      returned.

      Note that this method differs from "get_charset()" which returns
      the "Charset" instance for the default encoding of the message
      body.

                  *Message.get_charsets()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_charsets(failobj=None)

      Return a list containing the character set names in the message.
      If the message is a _multipart_, then the list will contain one
      element for each subpart in the payload, otherwise, it will be a
      list of length 1.

      Each item in the list will be a string which is the value of the
      "charset" parameter in the _Content-Type_ header for the
      represented subpart.  However, if the subpart has no _Content-
      Type_ header, no "charset" parameter, or is not of the _text_
      main MIME type, then that item in the returned list will be
      _failobj_.

       *Message.get_content_disposition()..email.compat32-message.txt*
   get_content_disposition()

      Return the lowercased value (without parameters) of the
      message’s _Content-Disposition_ header if it has one, or "None".
      The possible values for this method are _inline_, _attachment_
      or "None" if the message follows **RFC 2183**.

      New in version 3.5.

   walk()                    *Message.walk()..email.compat32-message.txt*

      The "walk()" method is an all-purpose generator which can be
      used to iterate over all the parts and subparts of a message
      object tree, in depth-first traversal order.  You will typically
      use "walk()" as the iterator in a "for" loop; each iteration
      returns the next subpart.

      Here’s an example that prints the MIME type of every part of a
      multipart message structure:
>
         >>> for part in msg.walk():
         ...     print(part.get_content_type())
         multipart/report
         text/plain
         message/delivery-status
         text/plain
         text/plain
         message/rfc822
         text/plain
<
      "walk" iterates over the subparts of any part where
      "is_multipart()" returns "True", even though
      "msg.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart'" may return "False".
      We can see this in our example by making use of the "_structure"
      debug helper function:
>
         >>> for part in msg.walk():
         ...     print(part.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart',
         ...           part.is_multipart())
         True True
         False False
         False True
         False False
         False False
         False True
         False False
         >>> _structure(msg)
         multipart/report
             text/plain
             message/delivery-status
                 text/plain
                 text/plain
             message/rfc822
                 text/plain
<
      Here the "message" parts are not "multiparts", but they do
      contain subparts. "is_multipart()" returns "True" and "walk"
      descends into the subparts.

   "Message" objects can also optionally contain two instance
   attributes, which can be used when generating the plain text of a
   MIME message.

   preamble                *Message.preamble..email.compat32-message.txt*

      The format of a MIME document allows for some text between the
      blank line following the headers, and the first multipart
      boundary string. Normally, this text is never visible in a MIME-
      aware mail reader because it falls outside the standard MIME
      armor.  However, when viewing the raw text of the message, or
      when viewing the message in a non-MIME aware reader, this text
      can become visible.

      The _preamble_ attribute contains this leading extra-armor text
      for MIME documents.  When the "Parser" discovers some text after
      the headers but before the first boundary string, it assigns
      this text to the message’s _preamble_ attribute.  When the
      "Generator" is writing out the plain text representation of a
      MIME message, and it finds the message has a _preamble_
      attribute, it will write this text in the area between the
      headers and the first boundary.  See "email.parser" and
      "email.generator" for details.

      Note that if the message object has no preamble, the _preamble_
      attribute will be "None".

   epilogue                *Message.epilogue..email.compat32-message.txt*

      The _epilogue_ attribute acts the same way as the _preamble_
      attribute, except that it contains text that appears between the
      last boundary and the end of the message.

      You do not need to set the epilogue to the empty string in order
      for the "Generator" to print a newline at the end of the file.

   defects                  *Message.defects..email.compat32-message.txt*

      The _defects_ attribute contains a list of all the problems
      found when parsing this message.  See "email.errors" for a
      detailed description of the possible parsing defects.
