"email.headerregistry": Custom Header Objects
*********************************************

**Source code:** Lib/email/headerregistry.py

======================================================================

New in version 3.6: [1]

Headers are represented by customized subclasses of "str".  The
particular class used to represent a given header is determined by the
"header_factory" of the "policy" in effect when the headers are
created.  This section documents the particular "header_factory"
implemented by the email package for handling **RFC 5322** compliant
email messages, which not only provides customized header objects for
various header types, but also provides an extension mechanism for
applications to add their own custom header types.

When using any of the policy objects derived from "EmailPolicy", all
headers are produced by "HeaderRegistry" and have "BaseHeader" as
their last base class.  Each header class has an additional base class
that is determined by the type of the header.  For example, many
headers have the class "UnstructuredHeader" as their other base class.
The specialized second class for a header is determined by the name of
the header, using a lookup table stored in the "HeaderRegistry".  All
of this is managed transparently for the typical application program,
but interfaces are provided for modifying the default behavior for use
by more complex applications.

The sections below first document the header base classes and their
attributes, followed by the API for modifying the behavior of
"HeaderRegistry", and finally the support classes used to represent
the data parsed from structured headers.

                                *BaseHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.BaseHeader(name, value)

   _name_ and _value_ are passed to "BaseHeader" from the
   "header_factory" call.  The string value of any header object is
   the _value_ fully decoded to unicode.

   This base class defines the following read-only properties:

   name                       *BaseHeader.name..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The name of the header (the portion of the field before the
      ‘:’).  This is exactly the value passed in the "header_factory"
      call for _name_; that is, case is preserved.

   defects                 *BaseHeader.defects..email.headerregistry.txt*

      A tuple of "HeaderDefect" instances reporting any RFC compliance
      problems found during parsing.  The email package tries to be
      complete about detecting compliance issues.  See the "errors"
      module for a discussion of the types of defects that may be
      reported.

   max_count             *BaseHeader.max_count..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The maximum number of headers of this type that can have the
      same "name".  A value of "None" means unlimited.  The
      "BaseHeader" value for this attribute is "None"; it is expected
      that specialized header classes will override this value as
      needed.

   "BaseHeader" also provides the following method, which is called by
   the email library code and should not in general be called by
   application programs:

   fold(*, policy)          *BaseHeader.fold()..email.headerregistry.txt*

      Return a string containing "linesep" characters as required to
      correctly fold the header according to _policy_.  A "cte_type"
      of "8bit" will be treated as if it were "7bit", since headers
      may not contain arbitrary binary data.  If "utf8" is "False",
      non-ASCII data will be **RFC 2047** encoded.

   "BaseHeader" by itself cannot be used to create a header object.
   It defines a protocol that each specialized header cooperates with
   in order to produce the header object.  Specifically, "BaseHeader"
   requires that the specialized class provide a "classmethod()" named
   "parse".  This method is called as follows:
>
      parse(string, kwds)
<
   "kwds" is a dictionary containing one pre-initialized key,
   "defects". "defects" is an empty list.  The parse method should
   append any detected defects to this list.  On return, the "kwds"
   dictionary _must_ contain values for at least the keys "decoded"
   and "defects".  "decoded" should be the string value for the header
   (that is, the header value fully decoded to unicode).  The parse
   method should assume that _string_ may contain content-transfer-
   encoded parts, but should correctly handle all valid unicode
   characters as well so that it can parse un-encoded header values.

   "BaseHeader"’s "__new__" then creates the header instance, and
   calls its "init" method.  The specialized class only needs to
   provide an "init" method if it wishes to set additional attributes
   beyond those provided by "BaseHeader" itself.  Such an "init"
   method should look like this:
>
      def init(self, /, *args, **kw):
          self._myattr = kw.pop('myattr')
          super().init(*args, **kw)
<
   That is, anything extra that the specialized class puts in to the
   "kwds" dictionary should be removed and handled, and the remaining
   contents of "kw" (and "args") passed to the "BaseHeader" "init"
   method.

                        *UnstructuredHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.UnstructuredHeader

   An “unstructured” header is the default type of header in **RFC
   5322**. Any header that does not have a specified syntax is treated
   as unstructured.  The classic example of an unstructured header is
   the _Subject_ header.

   In **RFC 5322**, an unstructured header is a run of arbitrary text
   in the ASCII character set.  **RFC 2047**, however, has an **RFC
   5322** compatible mechanism for encoding non-ASCII text as ASCII
   characters within a header value.  When a _value_ containing
   encoded words is passed to the constructor, the
   "UnstructuredHeader" parser converts such encoded words into
   unicode, following the **RFC 2047** rules for unstructured text.
   The parser uses heuristics to attempt to decode certain non-
   compliant encoded words.  Defects are registered in such cases, as
   well as defects for issues such as invalid characters within the
   encoded words or the non-encoded text.

   This header type provides no additional attributes.

                                *DateHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.DateHeader

   **RFC 5322** specifies a very specific format for dates within
   email headers. The "DateHeader" parser recognizes that date format,
   as well as recognizing a number of variant forms that are sometimes
   found “in the wild”.

   This header type provides the following additional attributes:

   datetime               *DateHeader.datetime..email.headerregistry.txt*

      If the header value can be recognized as a valid date of one
      form or another, this attribute will contain a "datetime"
      instance representing that date.  If the timezone of the input
      date is specified as "-0000" (indicating it is in UTC but
      contains no information about the source timezone), then
      "datetime" will be a naive "datetime".  If a specific timezone
      offset is found (including "+0000"), then "datetime" will
      contain an aware "datetime" that uses "datetime.timezone" to
      record the timezone offset.

   The "decoded" value of the header is determined by formatting the
   "datetime" according to the **RFC 5322** rules; that is, it is set
   to:
>
      email.utils.format_datetime(self.datetime)
<
   When creating a "DateHeader", _value_ may be "datetime" instance.
   This means, for example, that the following code is valid and does
   what one would expect:
>
      msg['Date'] = datetime(2011, 7, 15, 21)
<
   Because this is a naive "datetime" it will be interpreted as a UTC
   timestamp, and the resulting value will have a timezone of "-0000".
   Much more useful is to use the "localtime()" function from the
   "utils" module:
>
      msg['Date'] = utils.localtime()
<
   This example sets the date header to the current time and date
   using the current timezone offset.

                             *AddressHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.AddressHeader

   Address headers are one of the most complex structured header
   types. The "AddressHeader" class provides a generic interface to
   any address header.

   This header type provides the following additional attributes:

   groups                *AddressHeader.groups..email.headerregistry.txt*

      A tuple of "Group" objects encoding the addresses and groups
      found in the header value.  Addresses that are not part of a
      group are represented in this list as single-address "Groups"
      whose "display_name" is "None".

   addresses          *AddressHeader.addresses..email.headerregistry.txt*

      A tuple of "Address" objects encoding all of the individual
      addresses from the header value.  If the header value contains
      any groups, the individual addresses from the group are included
      in the list at the point where the group occurs in the value
      (that is, the list of addresses is “flattened” into a one
      dimensional list).

   The "decoded" value of the header will have all encoded words
   decoded to unicode.  "idna" encoded domain names are also decoded
   to unicode.  The "decoded" value is set by joining the "str" value
   of the elements of the "groups" attribute with "', '".

   A list of "Address" and "Group" objects in any combination may be
   used to set the value of an address header.  "Group" objects whose
   "display_name" is "None" will be interpreted as single addresses,
   which allows an address list to be copied with groups intact by
   using the list obtained from the "groups" attribute of the source
   header.

                       *SingleAddressHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.SingleAddressHeader

   A subclass of "AddressHeader" that adds one additional attribute:

   address        *SingleAddressHeader.address..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The single address encoded by the header value.  If the header
      value actually contains more than one address (which would be a
      violation of the RFC under the default "policy"), accessing this
      attribute will result in a "ValueError".

Many of the above classes also have a "Unique" variant (for example,
"UniqueUnstructuredHeader").  The only difference is that in the
"Unique" variant, "max_count" is set to 1.

                         *MIMEVersionHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.MIMEVersionHeader

   There is really only one valid value for the _MIME-Version_ header,
   and that is "1.0".  For future proofing, this header class supports
   other valid version numbers.  If a version number has a valid value
   per **RFC 2045**, then the header object will have non-"None"
   values for the following attributes:

   version          *MIMEVersionHeader.version..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The version number as a string, with any whitespace and/or
      comments removed.

   major              *MIMEVersionHeader.major..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The major version number as an integer

   minor              *MIMEVersionHeader.minor..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The minor version number as an integer

                   *ParameterizedMIMEHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.ParameterizedMIMEHeader

   MIME headers all start with the prefix ‘Content-’.  Each specific
   header has a certain value, described under the class for that
   header.  Some can also take a list of supplemental parameters,
   which have a common format. This class serves as a base for all the
   MIME headers that take parameters.

   params      *ParameterizedMIMEHeader.params..email.headerregistry.txt*

      A dictionary mapping parameter names to parameter values.

                         *ContentTypeHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.ContentTypeHeader

   A "ParameterizedMIMEHeader" class that handles the _Content-Type_
   header.

            *ContentTypeHeader.content_type..email.headerregistry.txt*
   content_type

      The content type string, in the form "maintype/subtype".

   maintype        *ContentTypeHeader.maintype..email.headerregistry.txt*

   subtype          *ContentTypeHeader.subtype..email.headerregistry.txt*

                  *ContentDispositionHeader..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.ContentDispositionHeader

   A "ParameterizedMIMEHeader" class that handles the _Content-
   Disposition_ header.

*ContentDispositionHeader.content_disposition..email.headerregistry.txt*
   content_disposition

      "inline" and "attachment" are the only valid values in common
      use.

                   *ContentTransferEncoding..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.ContentTransferEncoding

   Handles the _Content-Transfer-Encoding_ header.

   cte            *ContentTransferEncoding.cte..email.headerregistry.txt*

      Valid values are "7bit", "8bit", "base64", and "quoted-
      printable".  See **RFC 2045** for more information.

                            *HeaderRegistry..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.HeaderRegistry(base_class=BaseHeader, default_class=UnstructuredHeader, use_default_map=True)

   This is the factory used by "EmailPolicy" by default.
   "HeaderRegistry" builds the class used to create a header instance
   dynamically, using _base_class_ and a specialized class retrieved
   from a registry that it holds.  When a given header name does not
   appear in the registry, the class specified by _default_class_ is
   used as the specialized class.  When _use_default_map_ is "True"
   (the default), the standard mapping of header names to classes is
   copied in to the registry during initialization.  _base_class_ is
   always the last class in the generated class’s "__bases__" list.

   The default mappings are:

      subject:
         UniqueUnstructuredHeader

      date:
         UniqueDateHeader

      resent-date:
         DateHeader

      orig-date:
         UniqueDateHeader

      sender:
         UniqueSingleAddressHeader

      resent-sender:
         SingleAddressHeader

      to:
         UniqueAddressHeader

      resent-to:
         AddressHeader

      cc:
         UniqueAddressHeader

      resent-cc:
         AddressHeader

      bcc:
         UniqueAddressHeader

      resent-bcc:
         AddressHeader

      from:
         UniqueAddressHeader

      resent-from:
         AddressHeader

      reply-to:
         UniqueAddressHeader

      mime-version:
         MIMEVersionHeader

      content-type:
         ContentTypeHeader

      content-disposition:
         ContentDispositionHeader

      content-transfer-encoding:
         ContentTransferEncodingHeader

      message-id:
         MessageIDHeader

   "HeaderRegistry" has the following methods:

              *HeaderRegistry.map_to_type()..email.headerregistry.txt*
   map_to_type(self, name, cls)

      _name_ is the name of the header to be mapped.  It will be
      converted to lower case in the registry.  _cls_ is the
      specialized class to be used, along with _base_class_, to create
      the class used to instantiate headers that match _name_.

              *HeaderRegistry.__getitem__()..email.headerregistry.txt*
   __getitem__(name)

      Construct and return a class to handle creating a _name_ header.

                 *HeaderRegistry.__call__()..email.headerregistry.txt*
   __call__(name, value)

      Retrieves the specialized header associated with _name_ from the
      registry (using _default_class_ if _name_ does not appear in the
      registry) and composes it with _base_class_ to produce a class,
      calls the constructed class’s constructor, passing it the same
      argument list, and finally returns the class instance created
      thereby.

The following classes are the classes used to represent data parsed
from structured headers and can, in general, be used by an application
program to construct structured values to assign to specific headers.

                                   *Address..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.Address(display_name='', username='', domain='', addr_spec=None)

   The class used to represent an email address.  The general form of
   an address is:
>
      [display_name] <username@domain>
<
   or:
>
      username@domain
<
   where each part must conform to specific syntax rules spelled out
   in **RFC 5322**.

   As a convenience _addr_spec_ can be specified instead of _username_
   and _domain_, in which case _username_ and _domain_ will be parsed
   from the _addr_spec_.  An _addr_spec_ must be a properly RFC quoted
   string; if it is not "Address" will raise an error.  Unicode
   characters are allowed and will be property encoded when
   serialized.  However, per the RFCs, unicode is _not_ allowed in the
   username portion of the address.

   display_name          *Address.display_name..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The display name portion of the address, if any, with all
      quoting removed.  If the address does not have a display name,
      this attribute will be an empty string.

   username                  *Address.username..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The "username" portion of the address, with all quoting removed.

   domain                      *Address.domain..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The "domain" portion of the address.

   addr_spec                *Address.addr_spec..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The "username@domain" portion of the address, correctly quoted
      for use as a bare address (the second form shown above).  This
      attribute is not mutable.

   __str__()                *Address.__str__()..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The "str" value of the object is the address quoted according to
      **RFC 5322** rules, but with no Content Transfer Encoding of any
      non-ASCII characters.

   To support SMTP (**RFC 5321**), "Address" handles one special case:
   if "username" and "domain" are both the empty string (or "None"),
   then the string value of the "Address" is "<>".

                                     *Group..email.headerregistry.txt*
class email.headerregistry.Group(display_name=None, addresses=None)

   The class used to represent an address group.  The general form of
   an address group is:
>
      display_name: [address-list];
<
   As a convenience for processing lists of addresses that consist of
   a mixture of groups and single addresses, a "Group" may also be
   used to represent single addresses that are not part of a group by
   setting _display_name_ to "None" and providing a list of the single
   address as _addresses_.

   display_name            *Group.display_name..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The "display_name" of the group.  If it is "None" and there is
      exactly one "Address" in "addresses", then the "Group"
      represents a single address that is not in a group.

   addresses                  *Group.addresses..email.headerregistry.txt*

      A possibly empty tuple of "Address" objects representing the
      addresses in the group.

   __str__()                  *Group.__str__()..email.headerregistry.txt*

      The "str" value of a "Group" is formatted according to **RFC
      5322**, but with no Content Transfer Encoding of any non-ASCII
      characters.  If "display_name" is none and there is a single
      "Address" in the "addresses" list, the "str" value will be the
      same as the "str" of that single "Address".
