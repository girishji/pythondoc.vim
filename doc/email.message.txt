"email.message": Representing an email message
**********************************************

**Source code:** Lib/email/message.py

======================================================================

New in version 3.6: [1]

The central class in the "email" package is the "EmailMessage" class,
imported from the "email.message" module.  It is the base class for
the "email" object model.  "EmailMessage" provides the core
functionality for setting and querying header fields, for accessing
message bodies, and for creating or modifying structured messages.

An email message consists of _headers_ and a _payload_ (which is also
referred to as the _content_).  Headers are **RFC 5322** or **RFC
6532** style field names and values, where the field name and value
are separated by a colon.  The colon is not part of either the field
name or the field value.  The payload may be a simple text message, or
a binary object, or a structured sequence of sub-messages each with
their own set of headers and their own payload.  The latter type of
payload is indicated by the message having a MIME type such as
_multipart/*_ or _message/rfc822_.

The conceptual model provided by an "EmailMessage" object is that of
an ordered dictionary of headers coupled with a _payload_ that
represents the **RFC 5322** body of the message, which might be a list
of sub-"EmailMessage" objects.  In addition to the normal dictionary
methods for accessing the header names and values, there are methods
for accessing specialized information from the headers (for example
the MIME content type), for operating on the payload, for generating a
serialized version of the message, and for recursively walking over
the object tree.

The "EmailMessage" dictionary-like interface is indexed by the header
names, which must be ASCII values.  The values of the dictionary are
strings with some extra methods.  Headers are stored and returned in
case-preserving form, but field names are matched case-insensitively.
Unlike a real dict, there is an ordering to the keys, and there can be
duplicate keys.  Additional methods are provided for working with
headers that have duplicate keys.

The _payload_ is either a string or bytes object, in the case of
simple message objects, or a list of "EmailMessage" objects, for MIME
container documents such as _multipart/*_ and _message/rfc822_ message
objects.

                                     *EmailMessage..email.message.txt*
class email.message.EmailMessage(policy=default)

   If _policy_ is specified use the rules it specifies to update and
   serialize the representation of the message.  If _policy_ is not
   set, use the "default" policy, which follows the rules of the email
   RFCs except for line endings (instead of the RFC mandated "\r\n",
   it uses the Python standard "\n" line endings).  For more
   information see the "policy" documentation.

                         *EmailMessage.as_string()..email.message.txt*
   as_string(unixfrom=False, maxheaderlen=None, policy=None)

      Return the entire message flattened as a string.  When optional
      _unixfrom_ is true, the envelope header is included in the
      returned string.  _unixfrom_ defaults to "False".  For backward
      compatibility with the base "Message" class _maxheaderlen_ is
      accepted, but defaults to "None", which means that by default
      the line length is controlled by the "max_line_length" of the
      policy.  The _policy_ argument may be used to override the
      default policy obtained from the message instance.  This can be
      used to control some of the formatting produced by the method,
      since the specified _policy_ will be passed to the "Generator".

      Flattening the message may trigger changes to the "EmailMessage"
      if defaults need to be filled in to complete the transformation
      to a string (for example, MIME boundaries may be generated or
      modified).

      Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not
      be the most useful way to serialize messages in your
      application, especially if you are dealing with multiple
      messages.  See "email.generator.Generator" for a more flexible
      API for serializing messages.  Note also that this method is
      restricted to producing messages serialized as “7 bit clean”
      when "utf8" is "False", which is the default.

      Changed in version 3.6: the default behavior when _maxheaderlen_
      is not specified was changed from defaulting to 0 to defaulting
      to the value of _max_line_length_ from the policy.

   __str__()                  *EmailMessage.__str__()..email.message.txt*

      Equivalent to "as_string(policy=self.policy.clone(utf8=True))".
      Allows "str(msg)" to produce a string containing the serialized
      message in a readable format.

      Changed in version 3.4: the method was changed to use
      "utf8=True", thus producing an **RFC 6531**-like message
      representation, instead of being a direct alias for
      "as_string()".

                          *EmailMessage.as_bytes()..email.message.txt*
   as_bytes(unixfrom=False, policy=None)

      Return the entire message flattened as a bytes object.  When
      optional _unixfrom_ is true, the envelope header is included in
      the returned string.  _unixfrom_ defaults to "False".  The
      _policy_ argument may be used to override the default policy
      obtained from the message instance. This can be used to control
      some of the formatting produced by the method, since the
      specified _policy_ will be passed to the "BytesGenerator".

      Flattening the message may trigger changes to the "EmailMessage"
      if defaults need to be filled in to complete the transformation
      to a string (for example, MIME boundaries may be generated or
      modified).

      Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not
      be the most useful way to serialize messages in your
      application, especially if you are dealing with multiple
      messages.  See "email.generator.BytesGenerator" for a more
      flexible API for serializing messages.

   __bytes__()              *EmailMessage.__bytes__()..email.message.txt*

      Equivalent to "as_bytes()".  Allows "bytes(msg)" to produce a
      bytes object containing the serialized message.

   is_multipart()        *EmailMessage.is_multipart()..email.message.txt*

      Return "True" if the message’s payload is a list of
      sub-"EmailMessage" objects, otherwise return "False".  When
      "is_multipart()" returns "False", the payload should be a string
      object (which might be a CTE encoded binary payload).  Note that
      "is_multipart()" returning "True" does not necessarily mean that
      “msg.get_content_maintype() == ‘multipart’” will return the
      "True". For example, "is_multipart" will return "True" when the
      "EmailMessage" is of type "message/rfc822".

                      *EmailMessage.set_unixfrom()..email.message.txt*
   set_unixfrom(unixfrom)

      Set the message’s envelope header to _unixfrom_, which should be
      a string.  (See "mboxMessage" for a brief description of this
      header.)

   get_unixfrom()        *EmailMessage.get_unixfrom()..email.message.txt*

      Return the message’s envelope header.  Defaults to "None" if the
      envelope header was never set.

   The following methods implement the mapping-like interface for
   accessing the message’s headers.  Note that there are some semantic
   differences between these methods and a normal mapping (i.e.
   dictionary) interface.  For example, in a dictionary there are no
   duplicate keys, but here there may be duplicate message headers.
   Also, in dictionaries there is no guaranteed order to the keys
   returned by "keys()", but in an "EmailMessage" object, headers are
   always returned in the order they appeared in the original message,
   or in which they were added to the message later.  Any header
   deleted and then re-added is always appended to the end of the
   header list.

   These semantic differences are intentional and are biased toward
   convenience in the most common use cases.

   Note that in all cases, any envelope header present in the message
   is not included in the mapping interface.

   __len__()                  *EmailMessage.__len__()..email.message.txt*

      Return the total number of headers, including duplicates.

   __contains__(name)    *EmailMessage.__contains__()..email.message.txt*

      Return "True" if the message object has a field named _name_.
      Matching is done without regard to case and _name_ does not
      include the trailing colon.  Used for the "in" operator.  For
      example:
>
         if 'message-id' in myMessage:
            print('Message-ID:', myMessage['message-id'])
<
   __getitem__(name)      *EmailMessage.__getitem__()..email.message.txt*

      Return the value of the named header field.  _name_ does not
      include the colon field separator.  If the header is missing,
      "None" is returned; a "KeyError" is never raised.

      Note that if the named field appears more than once in the
      message’s headers, exactly which of those field values will be
      returned is undefined.  Use the "get_all()" method to get the
      values of all the extant headers named _name_.

      Using the standard (non-"compat32") policies, the returned value
      is an instance of a subclass of
      "email.headerregistry.BaseHeader".

                       *EmailMessage.__setitem__()..email.message.txt*
   __setitem__(name, val)

      Add a header to the message with field name _name_ and value
      _val_.  The field is appended to the end of the message’s
      existing headers.

      Note that this does _not_ overwrite or delete any existing
      header with the same name.  If you want to ensure that the new
      header is the only one present in the message with field name
      _name_, delete the field first, e.g.:
>
         del msg['subject']
         msg['subject'] = 'Python roolz!'
<
      If the "policy" defines certain headers to be unique (as the
      standard policies do), this method may raise a "ValueError" when
      an attempt is made to assign a value to such a header when one
      already exists.  This behavior is intentional for consistency’s
      sake, but do not depend on it as we may choose to make such
      assignments do an automatic deletion of the existing header in
      the future.

   __delitem__(name)      *EmailMessage.__delitem__()..email.message.txt*

      Delete all occurrences of the field with name _name_ from the
      message’s headers.  No exception is raised if the named field
      isn’t present in the headers.

   keys()                        *EmailMessage.keys()..email.message.txt*

      Return a list of all the message’s header field names.

   values()                    *EmailMessage.values()..email.message.txt*

      Return a list of all the message’s field values.

   items()                      *EmailMessage.items()..email.message.txt*

      Return a list of 2-tuples containing all the message’s field
      headers and values.

   get(name, failobj=None)        *EmailMessage.get()..email.message.txt*

      Return the value of the named header field.  This is identical
      to "__getitem__()" except that optional _failobj_ is returned if
      the named header is missing (_failobj_ defaults to "None").

   Here are some additional useful header related methods:

                           *EmailMessage.get_all()..email.message.txt*
   get_all(name, failobj=None)

      Return a list of all the values for the field named _name_. If
      there are no such named headers in the message, _failobj_ is
      returned (defaults to "None").

                        *EmailMessage.add_header()..email.message.txt*
   add_header(_name, _value, **_params)

      Extended header setting.  This method is similar to
      "__setitem__()" except that additional header parameters can be
      provided as keyword arguments.  __name_ is the header field to
      add and __value_ is the _primary_ value for the header.

      For each item in the keyword argument dictionary __params_, the
      key is taken as the parameter name, with underscores converted
      to dashes (since dashes are illegal in Python identifiers).
      Normally, the parameter will be added as "key="value"" unless
      the value is "None", in which case only the key will be added.

      If the value contains non-ASCII characters, the charset and
      language may be explicitly controlled by specifying the value as
      a three tuple in the format "(CHARSET, LANGUAGE, VALUE)", where
      "CHARSET" is a string naming the charset to be used to encode
      the value, "LANGUAGE" can usually be set to "None" or the empty
      string (see **RFC 2231** for other possibilities), and "VALUE"
      is the string value containing non-ASCII code points.  If a
      three tuple is not passed and the value contains non-ASCII
      characters, it is automatically encoded in **RFC 2231** format
      using a "CHARSET" of "utf-8" and a "LANGUAGE" of "None".

      Here is an example:
>
         msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')
<
      This will add a header that looks like
>
         Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bud.gif"
<
      An example of the extended interface with non-ASCII characters:
>
         msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment',
                        filename=('iso-8859-1', '', 'Fußballer.ppt'))
<

                    *EmailMessage.replace_header()..email.message.txt*
   replace_header(_name, _value)

      Replace a header.  Replace the first header found in the message
      that matches __name_, retaining header order and field name case
      of the original header.  If no matching header is found, raise a
      "KeyError".

                  *EmailMessage.get_content_type()..email.message.txt*
   get_content_type()

      Return the message’s content type, coerced to lower case of the
      form _maintype/subtype_.  If there is no _Content-Type_ header
      in the message return the value returned by
      "get_default_type()".  If the _Content-Type_ header is invalid,
      return "text/plain".

      (According to **RFC 2045**, messages always have a default type,
      "get_content_type()" will always return a value.  **RFC 2045**
      defines a message’s default type to be _text/plain_ unless it
      appears inside a _multipart/digest_ container, in which case it
      would be _message/rfc822_.  If the _Content-Type_ header has an
      invalid type specification, **RFC 2045** mandates that the
      default type be _text/plain_.)

              *EmailMessage.get_content_maintype()..email.message.txt*
   get_content_maintype()

      Return the message’s main content type.  This is the _maintype_
      part of the string returned by "get_content_type()".

               *EmailMessage.get_content_subtype()..email.message.txt*
   get_content_subtype()

      Return the message’s sub-content type.  This is the _subtype_
      part of the string returned by "get_content_type()".

                  *EmailMessage.get_default_type()..email.message.txt*
   get_default_type()

      Return the default content type.  Most messages have a default
      content type of _text/plain_, except for messages that are
      subparts of _multipart/digest_ containers.  Such subparts have a
      default content type of _message/rfc822_.

                  *EmailMessage.set_default_type()..email.message.txt*
   set_default_type(ctype)

      Set the default content type.  _ctype_ should either be
      _text/plain_ or _message/rfc822_, although this is not enforced.
      The default content type is not stored in the _Content-Type_
      header, so it only affects the return value of the
      "get_content_type" methods when no _Content-Type_ header is
      present in the message.

                         *EmailMessage.set_param()..email.message.txt*
   set_param(param, value, header='Content-Type', requote=True, charset=None, language='', replace=False)

      Set a parameter in the _Content-Type_ header.  If the parameter
      already exists in the header, replace its value with _value_.
      When _header_ is "Content-Type" (the default) and the header
      does not yet exist in the message, add it, set its value to
      _text/plain_, and append the new parameter value.  Optional
      _header_ specifies an alternative header to _Content-Type_.

      If the value contains non-ASCII characters, the charset and
      language may be explicitly specified using the optional
      _charset_ and _language_ parameters.  Optional _language_
      specifies the **RFC 2231** language, defaulting to the empty
      string.  Both _charset_ and _language_ should be strings.  The
      default is to use the "utf8" _charset_ and "None" for the
      _language_.

      If _replace_ is "False" (the default) the header is moved to the
      end of the list of headers.  If _replace_ is "True", the header
      will be updated in place.

      Use of the _requote_ parameter with "EmailMessage" objects is
      deprecated.

      Note that existing parameter values of headers may be accessed
      through the "params" attribute of the header value (for example,
      "msg['Content-Type'].params['charset']").

      Changed in version 3.4: "replace" keyword was added.

                         *EmailMessage.del_param()..email.message.txt*
   del_param(param, header='content-type', requote=True)

      Remove the given parameter completely from the _Content-Type_
      header.  The header will be re-written in place without the
      parameter or its value.  Optional _header_ specifies an
      alternative to _Content-Type_.

      Use of the _requote_ parameter with "EmailMessage" objects is
      deprecated.

                      *EmailMessage.get_filename()..email.message.txt*
   get_filename(failobj=None)

      Return the value of the "filename" parameter of the _Content-
      Disposition_ header of the message.  If the header does not have
      a "filename" parameter, this method falls back to looking for
      the "name" parameter on the _Content-Type_ header.  If neither
      is found, or the header is missing, then _failobj_ is returned.
      The returned string will always be unquoted as per
      "email.utils.unquote()".

                      *EmailMessage.get_boundary()..email.message.txt*
   get_boundary(failobj=None)

      Return the value of the "boundary" parameter of the _Content-
      Type_ header of the message, or _failobj_ if either the header
      is missing, or has no "boundary" parameter.  The returned string
      will always be unquoted as per "email.utils.unquote()".

                      *EmailMessage.set_boundary()..email.message.txt*
   set_boundary(boundary)

      Set the "boundary" parameter of the _Content-Type_ header to
      _boundary_.  "set_boundary()" will always quote _boundary_ if
      necessary.  A "HeaderParseError" is raised if the message object
      has no _Content-Type_ header.

      Note that using this method is subtly different from deleting
      the old _Content-Type_ header and adding a new one with the new
      boundary via "add_header()", because "set_boundary()" preserves
      the order of the _Content-Type_ header in the list of headers.

               *EmailMessage.get_content_charset()..email.message.txt*
   get_content_charset(failobj=None)

      Return the "charset" parameter of the _Content-Type_ header,
      coerced to lower case.  If there is no _Content-Type_ header, or
      if that header has no "charset" parameter, _failobj_ is
      returned.

                      *EmailMessage.get_charsets()..email.message.txt*
   get_charsets(failobj=None)

      Return a list containing the character set names in the message.
      If the message is a _multipart_, then the list will contain one
      element for each subpart in the payload, otherwise, it will be a
      list of length 1.

      Each item in the list will be a string which is the value of the
      "charset" parameter in the _Content-Type_ header for the
      represented subpart.  If the subpart has no _Content-Type_
      header, no "charset" parameter, or is not of the _text_ main
      MIME type, then that item in the returned list will be
      _failobj_.

   is_attachment()      *EmailMessage.is_attachment()..email.message.txt*

      Return "True" if there is a _Content-Disposition_ header and its
      (case insensitive) value is "attachment", "False" otherwise.

      Changed in version 3.4.2: is_attachment is now a method instead
      of a property, for consistency with "is_multipart()".

           *EmailMessage.get_content_disposition()..email.message.txt*
   get_content_disposition()

      Return the lowercased value (without parameters) of the
      message’s _Content-Disposition_ header if it has one, or "None".
      The possible values for this method are _inline_, _attachment_
      or "None" if the message follows **RFC 2183**.

      New in version 3.5.

   The following methods relate to interrogating and manipulating the
   content (payload) of the message.

   walk()                        *EmailMessage.walk()..email.message.txt*

      The "walk()" method is an all-purpose generator which can be
      used to iterate over all the parts and subparts of a message
      object tree, in depth-first traversal order.  You will typically
      use "walk()" as the iterator in a "for" loop; each iteration
      returns the next subpart.

      Here’s an example that prints the MIME type of every part of a
      multipart message structure:
>
         >>> for part in msg.walk():
         ...     print(part.get_content_type())
         multipart/report
         text/plain
         message/delivery-status
         text/plain
         text/plain
         message/rfc822
         text/plain
<
      "walk" iterates over the subparts of any part where
      "is_multipart()" returns "True", even though
      "msg.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart'" may return "False".
      We can see this in our example by making use of the "_structure"
      debug helper function:
>
         >>> from email.iterators import _structure
         >>> for part in msg.walk():
         ...     print(part.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart',
         ...           part.is_multipart())
         True True
         False False
         False True
         False False
         False False
         False True
         False False
         >>> _structure(msg)
         multipart/report
             text/plain
             message/delivery-status
                 text/plain
                 text/plain
             message/rfc822
                 text/plain
<
      Here the "message" parts are not "multiparts", but they do
      contain subparts. "is_multipart()" returns "True" and "walk"
      descends into the subparts.

                          *EmailMessage.get_body()..email.message.txt*
   get_body(preferencelist=('related', 'html', 'plain'))

      Return the MIME part that is the best candidate to be the “body”
      of the message.

      _preferencelist_ must be a sequence of strings from the set
      "related", "html", and "plain", and indicates the order of
      preference for the content type of the part returned.

      Start looking for candidate matches with the object on which the
      "get_body" method is called.

      If "related" is not included in _preferencelist_, consider the
      root part (or subpart of the root part) of any related
      encountered as a candidate if the (sub-)part matches a
      preference.

      When encountering a "multipart/related", check the "start"
      parameter and if a part with a matching _Content-ID_ is found,
      consider only it when looking for candidate matches.  Otherwise
      consider only the first (default root) part of the
      "multipart/related".

      If a part has a _Content-Disposition_ header, only consider the
      part a candidate match if the value of the header is "inline".

      If none of the candidates matches any of the preferences in
      _preferencelist_, return "None".

      Notes: (1) For most applications the only _preferencelist_
      combinations that really make sense are "('plain',)", "('html',
      'plain')", and the default "('related', 'html', 'plain')".  (2)
      Because matching starts with the object on which "get_body" is
      called, calling "get_body" on a "multipart/related" will return
      the object itself unless _preferencelist_ has a non-default
      value. (3) Messages (or message parts) that do not specify a
      _Content-Type_ or whose _Content-Type_ header is invalid will be
      treated as if they are of type "text/plain", which may
      occasionally cause "get_body" to return unexpected results.

                  *EmailMessage.iter_attachments()..email.message.txt*
   iter_attachments()

      Return an iterator over all of the immediate sub-parts of the
      message that are not candidate “body” parts.  That is, skip the
      first occurrence of each of "text/plain", "text/html",
      "multipart/related", or "multipart/alternative" (unless they are
      explicitly marked as attachments via _Content-Disposition:
      attachment_), and return all remaining parts.  When applied
      directly to a "multipart/related", return an iterator over the
      all the related parts except the root part (ie: the part pointed
      to by the "start" parameter, or the first part if there is no
      "start" parameter or the "start" parameter doesn’t match the
      _Content-ID_ of any of the parts).  When applied directly to a
      "multipart/alternative" or a non-"multipart", return an empty
      iterator.

   iter_parts()            *EmailMessage.iter_parts()..email.message.txt*

      Return an iterator over all of the immediate sub-parts of the
      message, which will be empty for a non-"multipart".  (See also
      "walk()".)

                       *EmailMessage.get_content()..email.message.txt*
   get_content(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)

      Call the "get_content()" method of the _content_manager_,
      passing self as the message object, and passing along any other
      arguments or keywords as additional arguments.  If
      _content_manager_ is not specified, use the "content_manager"
      specified by the current "policy".

                       *EmailMessage.set_content()..email.message.txt*
   set_content(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)

      Call the "set_content()" method of the _content_manager_,
      passing self as the message object, and passing along any other
      arguments or keywords as additional arguments.  If
      _content_manager_ is not specified, use the "content_manager"
      specified by the current "policy".

                      *EmailMessage.make_related()..email.message.txt*
   make_related(boundary=None)

      Convert a non-"multipart" message into a "multipart/related"
      message, moving any existing _Content-_ headers and payload into
      a (new) first part of the "multipart".  If _boundary_ is
      specified, use it as the boundary string in the multipart,
      otherwise leave the boundary to be automatically created when it
      is needed (for example, when the message is serialized).

                  *EmailMessage.make_alternative()..email.message.txt*
   make_alternative(boundary=None)

      Convert a non-"multipart" or a "multipart/related" into a
      "multipart/alternative", moving any existing _Content-_ headers
      and payload into a (new) first part of the "multipart".  If
      _boundary_ is specified, use it as the boundary string in the
      multipart, otherwise leave the boundary to be automatically
      created when it is needed (for example, when the message is
      serialized).

                        *EmailMessage.make_mixed()..email.message.txt*
   make_mixed(boundary=None)

      Convert a non-"multipart", a "multipart/related", or a
      "multipart-alternative" into a "multipart/mixed", moving any
      existing _Content-_ headers and payload into a (new) first part
      of the "multipart".  If _boundary_ is specified, use it as the
      boundary string in the multipart, otherwise leave the boundary
      to be automatically created when it is needed (for example, when
      the message is serialized).

                       *EmailMessage.add_related()..email.message.txt*
   add_related(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)

      If the message is a "multipart/related", create a new message
      object, pass all of the arguments to its "set_content()" method,
      and "attach()" it to the "multipart".  If the message is a
      non-"multipart", call "make_related()" and then proceed as
      above.  If the message is any other type of "multipart", raise a
      "TypeError". If _content_manager_ is not specified, use the
      "content_manager" specified by the current "policy". If the
      added part has no _Content-Disposition_ header, add one with the
      value "inline".

                   *EmailMessage.add_alternative()..email.message.txt*
   add_alternative(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)

      If the message is a "multipart/alternative", create a new
      message object, pass all of the arguments to its "set_content()"
      method, and "attach()" it to the "multipart".  If the message is
      a non-"multipart" or "multipart/related", call
      "make_alternative()" and then proceed as above.  If the message
      is any other type of "multipart", raise a "TypeError". If
      _content_manager_ is not specified, use the "content_manager"
      specified by the current "policy".

                    *EmailMessage.add_attachment()..email.message.txt*
   add_attachment(*args, content_manager=None, **kw)

      If the message is a "multipart/mixed", create a new message
      object, pass all of the arguments to its "set_content()" method,
      and "attach()" it to the "multipart".  If the message is a
      non-"multipart", "multipart/related", or
      "multipart/alternative", call "make_mixed()" and then proceed as
      above. If _content_manager_ is not specified, use the
      "content_manager" specified by the current "policy".  If the
      added part has no _Content-Disposition_ header, add one with the
      value "attachment".  This method can be used both for explicit
      attachments (_Content-Disposition: attachment_) and "inline"
      attachments (_Content-Disposition: inline_), by passing
      appropriate options to the "content_manager".

   clear()                      *EmailMessage.clear()..email.message.txt*

      Remove the payload and all of the headers.

   clear_content()      *EmailMessage.clear_content()..email.message.txt*

      Remove the payload and all of the _!Content-_ headers, leaving
      all other headers intact and in their original order.

   "EmailMessage" objects have the following instance attributes:

   preamble                    *EmailMessage.preamble..email.message.txt*

      The format of a MIME document allows for some text between the
      blank line following the headers, and the first multipart
      boundary string. Normally, this text is never visible in a MIME-
      aware mail reader because it falls outside the standard MIME
      armor.  However, when viewing the raw text of the message, or
      when viewing the message in a non-MIME aware reader, this text
      can become visible.

      The _preamble_ attribute contains this leading extra-armor text
      for MIME documents.  When the "Parser" discovers some text after
      the headers but before the first boundary string, it assigns
      this text to the message’s _preamble_ attribute.  When the
      "Generator" is writing out the plain text representation of a
      MIME message, and it finds the message has a _preamble_
      attribute, it will write this text in the area between the
      headers and the first boundary.  See "email.parser" and
      "email.generator" for details.

      Note that if the message object has no preamble, the _preamble_
      attribute will be "None".

   epilogue                    *EmailMessage.epilogue..email.message.txt*

      The _epilogue_ attribute acts the same way as the _preamble_
      attribute, except that it contains text that appears between the
      last boundary and the end of the message.  As with the
      "preamble", if there is no epilog text this attribute will be
      "None".

   defects                      *EmailMessage.defects..email.message.txt*

      The _defects_ attribute contains a list of all the problems
      found when parsing this message.  See "email.errors" for a
      detailed description of the possible parsing defects.

                                         *MIMEPart..email.message.txt*
class email.message.MIMEPart(policy=default)

   This class represents a subpart of a MIME message.  It is identical
   to "EmailMessage", except that no _MIME-Version_ headers are added
   when "set_content()" is called, since sub-parts do not need their
   own _MIME-Version_ headers.
