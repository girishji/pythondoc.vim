"fileinput" — Iterate over lines from multiple input streams
************************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/fileinput.py

======================================================================

This module implements a helper class and functions to quickly write a
loop over standard input or a list of files. If you just want to read
or write one file see "open()".

The typical use is:
>
   import fileinput
   for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"):
       process(line)
<
This iterates over the lines of all files listed in "sys.argv[1:]",
defaulting to "sys.stdin" if the list is empty.  If a filename is
"'-'", it is also replaced by "sys.stdin" and the optional arguments
_mode_ and _openhook_ are ignored.  To specify an alternative list of
filenames, pass it as the first argument to "input()".  A single file
name is also allowed.

All files are opened in text mode by default, but you can override
this by specifying the _mode_ parameter in the call to "input()" or
"FileInput".  If an I/O error occurs during opening or reading a file,
"OSError" is raised.

Changed in version 3.3: "IOError" used to be raised; it is now an
alias of "OSError".

If "sys.stdin" is used more than once, the second and further use will
return no lines, except perhaps for interactive use, or if it has been
explicitly reset (e.g. using "sys.stdin.seek(0)").

Empty files are opened and immediately closed; the only time their
presence in the list of filenames is noticeable at all is when the
last file opened is empty.

Lines are returned with any newlines intact, which means that the last
line in a file may not have one.

You can control how files are opened by providing an opening hook via
the _openhook_ parameter to "fileinput.input()" or "FileInput()". The
hook must be a function that takes two arguments, _filename_ and
_mode_, and returns an accordingly opened file-like object. If
_encoding_ and/or _errors_ are specified, they will be passed to the
hook as additional keyword arguments. This module provides a
"hook_compressed()" to support compressed files.

The following function is the primary interface of this module:

                                              *input()..fileinput.txt*
fileinput.input(files=None, inplace=False, backup='', *, mode='r', openhook=None, encoding=None, errors=None)

   Create an instance of the "FileInput" class.  The instance will be
   used as global state for the functions of this module, and is also
   returned to use during iteration.  The parameters to this function
   will be passed along to the constructor of the "FileInput" class.

   The "FileInput" instance can be used as a context manager in the
   "with" statement.  In this example, _input_ is closed after the
   "with" statement is exited, even if an exception occurs:
>
      with fileinput.input(files=('spam.txt', 'eggs.txt'), encoding="utf-8") as f:
          for line in f:
              process(line)
<
   Changed in version 3.2: Can be used as a context manager.

   Changed in version 3.8: The keyword parameters _mode_ and
   _openhook_ are now keyword-only.

   Changed in version 3.10: The keyword-only parameter _encoding_ and
   _errors_ are added.

The following functions use the global state created by
"fileinput.input()"; if there is no active state, "RuntimeError" is
raised.

fileinput.filename()                       *filename()..fileinput.txt*

   Return the name of the file currently being read.  Before the first
   line has been read, returns "None".

fileinput.fileno()                           *fileno()..fileinput.txt*

   Return the integer “file descriptor” for the current file. When no
   file is opened (before the first line and between files), returns
   "-1".

fileinput.lineno()                           *lineno()..fileinput.txt*

   Return the cumulative line number of the line that has just been
   read.  Before the first line has been read, returns "0".  After the
   last line of the last file has been read, returns the line number
   of that line.

fileinput.filelineno()                   *filelineno()..fileinput.txt*

   Return the line number in the current file.  Before the first line
   has been read, returns "0".  After the last line of the last file
   has been read, returns the line number of that line within the
   file.

fileinput.isfirstline()                 *isfirstline()..fileinput.txt*

   Return "True" if the line just read is the first line of its file,
   otherwise return "False".

fileinput.isstdin()                         *isstdin()..fileinput.txt*

   Return "True" if the last line was read from "sys.stdin", otherwise
   return "False".

fileinput.nextfile()                       *nextfile()..fileinput.txt*

   Close the current file so that the next iteration will read the
   first line from the next file (if any); lines not read from the
   file will not count towards the cumulative line count.  The
   filename is not changed until after the first line of the next file
   has been read.  Before the first line has been read, this function
   has no effect; it cannot be used to skip the first file.  After the
   last line of the last file has been read, this function has no
   effect.

fileinput.close()                             *close()..fileinput.txt*

   Close the sequence.

The class which implements the sequence behavior provided by the
module is available for subclassing as well:

                                            *FileInput..fileinput.txt*
class fileinput.FileInput(files=None, inplace=False, backup='', *, mode='r', openhook=None, encoding=None, errors=None)

   Class "FileInput" is the implementation; its methods "filename()",
   "fileno()", "lineno()", "filelineno()", "isfirstline()",
   "isstdin()", "nextfile()" and "close()" correspond to the functions
   of the same name in the module. In addition it is _iterable_ and
   has a "readline()" method which returns the next input line. The
   sequence must be accessed in strictly sequential order; random
   access and "readline()" cannot be mixed.

   With _mode_ you can specify which file mode will be passed to
   "open()". It must be one of "'r'" and "'rb'".

   The _openhook_, when given, must be a function that takes two
   arguments, _filename_ and _mode_, and returns an accordingly opened
   file-like object. You cannot use _inplace_ and _openhook_ together.

   You can specify _encoding_ and _errors_ that is passed to "open()"
   or _openhook_.

   A "FileInput" instance can be used as a context manager in the
   "with" statement.  In this example, _input_ is closed after the
   "with" statement is exited, even if an exception occurs:
>
      with FileInput(files=('spam.txt', 'eggs.txt')) as input:
          process(input)
<
   Changed in version 3.2: Can be used as a context manager.

   Changed in version 3.8: The keyword parameter _mode_ and _openhook_
   are now keyword-only.

   Changed in version 3.10: The keyword-only parameter _encoding_ and
   _errors_ are added.

   Changed in version 3.11: The "'rU'" and "'U'" modes and the
   "__getitem__()" method have been removed.

**Optional in-place filtering:** if the keyword argument
"inplace=True" is passed to "fileinput.input()" or to the "FileInput"
constructor, the file is moved to a backup file and standard output is
directed to the input file (if a file of the same name as the backup
file already exists, it will be replaced silently).  This makes it
possible to write a filter that rewrites its input file in place.  If
the _backup_ parameter is given (typically as "backup='.<some
extension>'"), it specifies the extension for the backup file, and the
backup file remains around; by default, the extension is "'.bak'" and
it is deleted when the output file is closed.  In-place filtering is
disabled when standard input is read.

The two following opening hooks are provided by this module:

                                    *hook_compressed()..fileinput.txt*
fileinput.hook_compressed(filename, mode, *, encoding=None, errors=None)

   Transparently opens files compressed with gzip and bzip2
   (recognized by the extensions "'.gz'" and "'.bz2'") using the
   "gzip" and "bz2" modules.  If the filename extension is not "'.gz'"
   or "'.bz2'", the file is opened normally (ie, using "open()"
   without any decompression).

   The _encoding_ and _errors_ values are passed to "io.TextIOWrapper"
   for compressed files and open for normal files.

   Usage example:  "fi =
   fileinput.FileInput(openhook=fileinput.hook_compressed,
   encoding="utf-8")"

   Changed in version 3.10: The keyword-only parameter _encoding_ and
   _errors_ are added.

                                       *hook_encoded()..fileinput.txt*
fileinput.hook_encoded(encoding, errors=None)

   Returns a hook which opens each file with "open()", using the given
   _encoding_ and _errors_ to read the file.

   Usage example: "fi =
   fileinput.FileInput(openhook=fileinput.hook_encoded("utf-8",
   "surrogateescape"))"

   Changed in version 3.6: Added the optional _errors_ parameter.

   Deprecated since version 3.10: This function is deprecated since
   "fileinput.input()" and "FileInput" now have _encoding_ and
   _errors_ parameters.
