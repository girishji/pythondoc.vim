"gzip" — Support for **gzip** files
***********************************

**Source code:** Lib/gzip.py

======================================================================

This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress
files just like the GNU programs **gzip** and **gunzip** would.

The data compression is provided by the "zlib" module.

The "gzip" module provides the "GzipFile" class, as well as the
"open()", "compress()" and "decompress()" convenience functions. The
"GzipFile" class reads and writes **gzip**-format files, automatically
compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks like an
ordinary _file object_.

Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the
**gzip** and **gunzip** programs, such  as those produced by
**compress** and **pack**, are not supported by this module.

The module defines the following items:

                                                   *open()..gzip.txt;*
gzip.open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None)

   Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a
   _file object_.

   The _filename_ argument can be an actual filename (a "str" or
   "bytes" object), or an existing file object to read from or write
   to.

   The _mode_ argument can be any of "'r'", "'rb'", "'a'", "'ab'",
   "'w'", "'wb'", "'x'" or "'xb'" for binary mode, or "'rt'", "'at'",
   "'wt'", or "'xt'" for text mode. The default is "'rb'".

   The _compresslevel_ argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the
   "GzipFile" constructor.

   For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the "GzipFile"
   constructor: "GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel)". In this
   case, the _encoding_, _errors_ and _newline_ arguments must not be
   provided.

   For text mode, a "GzipFile" object is created, and wrapped in an
   "io.TextIOWrapper" instance with the specified encoding, error
   handling behavior, and line ending(s).

   Changed in version 3.3: Added support for _filename_ being a file
   object, support for text mode, and the _encoding_, _errors_ and
   _newline_ arguments.

   Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the "'x'", "'xb'" and
   "'xt'" modes.

   Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a _path-like object_.

exception gzip.BadGzipFile                    *BadGzipFile..gzip.txt;*

   An exception raised for invalid gzip files.  It inherits "OSError".
   "EOFError" and "zlib.error" can also be raised for invalid gzip
   files.

   New in version 3.8.

                                                 *GzipFile..gzip.txt;*
class gzip.GzipFile(filename=None, mode=None, compresslevel=9, fileobj=None, mtime=None)

   Constructor for the "GzipFile" class, which simulates most of the
   methods of a _file object_, with the exception of the "truncate()"
   method.  At least one of _fileobj_ and _filename_ must be given a
   non-trivial value.

   The new class instance is based on _fileobj_, which can be a
   regular file, an "io.BytesIO" object, or any other object which
   simulates a file.  It defaults to "None", in which case _filename_
   is opened to provide a file object.

   When _fileobj_ is not "None", the _filename_ argument is only used
   to be included in the **gzip** file header, which may include the
   original filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the
   filename of _fileobj_, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to
   the empty string, and in this case the original filename is not
   included in the header.

   The _mode_ argument can be any of "'r'", "'rb'", "'a'", "'ab'",
   "'w'", "'wb'", "'x'", or "'xb'", depending on whether the file will
   be read or written.  The default is the mode of _fileobj_ if
   discernible; otherwise, the default is "'rb'".  In future Python
   releases the mode of _fileobj_ will not be used.  It is better to
   always specify _mode_ for writing.

   Note that the file is always opened in binary mode. To open a
   compressed file in text mode, use "open()" (or wrap your "GzipFile"
   with an "io.TextIOWrapper").

   The _compresslevel_ argument is an integer from "0" to "9"
   controlling the level of compression; "1" is fastest and produces
   the least compression, and "9" is slowest and produces the most
   compression. "0" is no compression. The default is "9".

   The _mtime_ argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written
   to the last modification time field in the stream when compressing.
   It should only be provided in compression mode.  If omitted or
   "None", the current time is used.  See the "mtime" attribute for
   more details.

   Calling a "GzipFile" object’s "close()" method does not close
   _fileobj_, since you might wish to append more material after the
   compressed data.  This also allows you to pass an "io.BytesIO"
   object opened for writing as _fileobj_, and retrieve the resulting
   memory buffer using the "io.BytesIO" object’s "getvalue()" method.

   "GzipFile" supports the "io.BufferedIOBase" interface, including
   iteration and the "with" statement.  Only the "truncate()" method
   isn’t implemented.

   "GzipFile" also provides the following method and attribute:

   peek(n)                                   *GzipFile.peek()..gzip.txt;*

      Read _n_ uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position.
      At most one single read on the compressed stream is done to
      satisfy the call.  The number of bytes returned may be more or
      less than requested.

      Note:

        While calling "peek()" does not change the file position of
        the "GzipFile", it may change the position of the underlying
        file object (e.g. if the "GzipFile" was constructed with the
        _fileobj_ parameter).

      New in version 3.2.

   mtime                                      *GzipFile.mtime..gzip.txt;*

      When decompressing, the value of the last modification time
      field in the most recently read header may be read from this
      attribute, as an integer.  The initial value before reading any
      headers is "None".

      All **gzip** compressed streams are required to contain this
      timestamp field.  Some programs, such as **gunzip**, make use of
      the timestamp.  The format is the same as the return value of
      "time.time()" and the "st_mtime" attribute of the object
      returned by "os.stat()".

   name                                        *GzipFile.name..gzip.txt;*

      The path to the gzip file on disk, as a "str" or "bytes".
      Equivalent to the output of "os.fspath()" on the original input
      path, with no other normalization, resolution or expansion.

   Changed in version 3.1: Support for the "with" statement was added,
   along with the _mtime_ constructor argument and "mtime" attribute.

   Changed in version 3.2: Support for zero-padded and unseekable
   files was added.

   Changed in version 3.3: The "io.BufferedIOBase.read1()" method is
   now implemented.

   Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the "'x'" and "'xb'"
   modes.

   Changed in version 3.5: Added support for writing arbitrary _bytes-
   like objects_. The "read()" method now accepts an argument of
   "None".

   Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a _path-like object_.

   Changed in version 3.12: Remove the "filename" attribute, use the
   "name" attribute instead.

   Deprecated since version 3.9: Opening "GzipFile" for writing
   without specifying the _mode_ argument is deprecated.

                                               *compress()..gzip.txt;*
gzip.compress(data, compresslevel=9, *, mtime=None)

   Compress the _data_, returning a "bytes" object containing the
   compressed data.  _compresslevel_ and _mtime_ have the same meaning
   as in the "GzipFile" constructor above. When _mtime_ is set to "0",
   this function is equivalent to "zlib.compress()" with _wbits_ set
   to "31". The zlib function is faster.

   New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.8: Added the _mtime_ parameter for
   reproducible output.

   Changed in version 3.11: Speed is improved by compressing all data
   at once instead of in a streamed fashion. Calls with _mtime_ set to
   "0" are delegated to "zlib.compress()" for better speed.

gzip.decompress(data)                        *decompress()..gzip.txt;*

   Decompress the _data_, returning a "bytes" object containing the
   uncompressed data. This function is capable of decompressing multi-
   member gzip data (multiple gzip blocks concatenated together). When
   the data is certain to contain only one member the
   "zlib.decompress()" function with _wbits_ set to 31 is faster.

   New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.11: Speed is improved by decompressing members
   at once in memory instead of in a streamed fashion.

Command Line Interface
======================

The "gzip" module provides a simple command line interface to compress
or decompress files.

Once executed the "gzip" module keeps the input file(s).

Changed in version 3.8: Add a new command line interface with a usage.
By default, when you will execute the CLI, the default compression
level is 6.
