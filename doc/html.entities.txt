"html.entities" — Definitions of HTML general entities
******************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/html/entities.py

======================================================================

This module defines four dictionaries, "html5", "name2codepoint",
"codepoint2name", and "entitydefs".

html.entities.html5                         *html5..htmlentities.txt;*

   A dictionary that maps HTML5 named character references [1] to the
   equivalent Unicode character(s), e.g. "html5['gt;'] == '>'". Note
   that the trailing semicolon is included in the name (e.g. "'gt;'"),
   however some of the names are accepted by the standard even without
   the semicolon: in this case the name is present with and without
   the "';'". See also "html.unescape()".

   New in version 3.3.

html.entities.entitydefs               *entitydefs..htmlentities.txt;*

   A dictionary mapping XHTML 1.0 entity definitions to their
   replacement text in ISO Latin-1.

html.entities.name2codepoint       *name2codepoint..htmlentities.txt;*

   A dictionary that maps HTML4 entity names to the Unicode code
   points.

html.entities.codepoint2name       *codepoint2name..htmlentities.txt;*

   A dictionary that maps Unicode code points to HTML4 entity names.
