"importlib.resources" – Package resource reading, opening and access
********************************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/importlib/resources/__init__.py

======================================================================

New in version 3.7.

This module leverages Python’s import system to provide access to
_resources_ within _packages_.

“Resources” are file-like resources associated with a module or
package in Python. The resources may be contained directly in a
package, within a subdirectory contained in that package, or adjacent
to modules outside a package. Resources may be text or binary. As a
result, Python module sources (.py) of a package and compilation
artifacts (pycache) are technically de-facto resources of that
package. In practice, however, resources are primarily those non-
Python artifacts exposed specifically by the package author.

Resources can be opened or read in either binary or text mode.

Resources are roughly akin to files inside directories, though it’s
important to keep in mind that this is just a metaphor.  Resources and
packages **do not** have to exist as physical files and directories on
the file system: for example, a package and its resources can be
imported from a zip file using "zipimport".

Note:

  This module provides functionality similar to pkg_resources Basic
  Resource Access without the performance overhead of that package.
  This makes reading resources included in packages easier, with more
  stable and consistent semantics.The standalone backport of this
  module provides more information on using importlib.resources and
  migrating from pkg_resources to importlib.resources.

"Loaders" that wish to support resource reading should implement a
"get_resource_reader(fullname)" method as specified by
"importlib.resources.abc.ResourceReader".

importlib.resources.Anchor           *Anchor..importlibresources.txt;*

   Represents an anchor for resources, either a "module object" or a
   module name as a string. Defined as "Union[str, ModuleType]".

                                    *files()..importlibresources.txt;*
importlib.resources.files(anchor: Anchor | None = None)

   Returns a "Traversable" object representing the resource container
   (think directory) and its resources (think files). A Traversable
   may contain other containers (think subdirectories).

   _anchor_ is an optional "Anchor". If the anchor is a package,
   resources are resolved from that package. If a module, resources
   are resolved adjacent to that module (in the same package or the
   package root). If the anchor is omitted, the caller’s module is
   used.

   New in version 3.9.

   Changed in version 3.12: “package” parameter was renamed to
   “anchor”. “anchor” can now be a non-package module and if omitted
   will default to the caller’s module. “package” is still accepted
   for compatibility but will raise a DeprecationWarning. Consider
   passing the anchor positionally or using "importlib_resources >=
   5.10" for a compatible interface on older Pythons.

                                  *as_file()..importlibresources.txt;*
importlib.resources.as_file(traversable)

   Given a "Traversable" object representing a file or directory,
   typically from "importlib.resources.files()", return a context
   manager for use in a "with" statement. The context manager provides
   a "pathlib.Path" object.

   Exiting the context manager cleans up any temporary file or
   directory created when the resource was extracted from e.g. a zip
   file.

   Use "as_file" when the Traversable methods ("read_text", etc) are
   insufficient and an actual file or directory on the file system is
   required.

   New in version 3.9.

   Changed in version 3.12: Added support for "traversable"
   representing a directory.
