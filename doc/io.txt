"io" — Core tools for working with streams
******************************************

**Source code:** Lib/io.py

======================================================================


Overview
========

The "io" module provides Python’s main facilities for dealing with
various types of I/O.  There are three main types of I/O: _text I/O_,
_binary I/O_ and _raw I/O_.  These are generic categories, and various
backing stores can be used for each of them.  A concrete object
belonging to any of these categories is called a _file object_.  Other
common terms are _stream_ and _file-like object_.

Independent of its category, each concrete stream object will also
have various capabilities: it can be read-only, write-only, or read-
write. It can also allow arbitrary random access (seeking forwards or
backwards to any location), or only sequential access (for example in
the case of a socket or pipe).

All streams are careful about the type of data you give to them.  For
example giving a "str" object to the "write()" method of a binary
stream will raise a "TypeError".  So will giving a "bytes" object to
the "write()" method of a text stream.

Changed in version 3.3: Operations that used to raise "IOError" now
raise "OSError", since "IOError" is now an alias of "OSError".


Text I/O
--------

Text I/O expects and produces "str" objects.  This means that whenever
the backing store is natively made of bytes (such as in the case of a
file), encoding and decoding of data is made transparently as well as
optional translation of platform-specific newline characters.

The easiest way to create a text stream is with "open()", optionally
specifying an encoding:
>
   f = open("myfile.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
<
In-memory text streams are also available as "StringIO" objects:
>
   f = io.StringIO("some initial text data")
<
The text stream API is described in detail in the documentation of
"TextIOBase".


Binary I/O
----------

Binary I/O (also called _buffered I/O_) expects _bytes-like objects_
and produces "bytes" objects.  No encoding, decoding, or newline
translation is performed.  This category of streams can be used for
all kinds of non-text data, and also when manual control over the
handling of text data is desired.

The easiest way to create a binary stream is with "open()" with "'b'"
in the mode string:
>
   f = open("myfile.jpg", "rb")
<
In-memory binary streams are also available as "BytesIO" objects:
>
   f = io.BytesIO(b"some initial binary data: \x00\x01")
<
The binary stream API is described in detail in the docs of
"BufferedIOBase".

Other library modules may provide additional ways to create text or
binary streams.  See "socket.socket.makefile()" for example.


Raw I/O
-------

Raw I/O (also called _unbuffered I/O_) is generally used as a low-
level building-block for binary and text streams; it is rarely useful
to directly manipulate a raw stream from user code.  Nevertheless, you
can create a raw stream by opening a file in binary mode with
buffering disabled:
>
   f = open("myfile.jpg", "rb", buffering=0)
<
The raw stream API is described in detail in the docs of "RawIOBase".


Text Encoding
=============

The default encoding of "TextIOWrapper" and "open()" is locale-
specific ("locale.getencoding()").

However, many developers forget to specify the encoding when opening
text files encoded in UTF-8 (e.g. JSON, TOML, Markdown, etc…) since
most Unix platforms use UTF-8 locale by default. This causes bugs
because the locale encoding is not UTF-8 for most Windows users. For
example:
>
   # May not work on Windows when non-ASCII characters in the file.
   with open("README.md") as f:
       long_description = f.read()
<
Accordingly, it is highly recommended that you specify the encoding
explicitly when opening text files. If you want to use UTF-8, pass
"encoding="utf-8"". To use the current locale encoding,
"encoding="locale"" is supported since Python 3.10.

See also:

  Python UTF-8 Mode
     Python UTF-8 Mode can be used to change the default encoding to
     UTF-8 from locale-specific encoding.

  **PEP 686**
     Python 3.15 will make Python UTF-8 Mode default.


Opt-in EncodingWarning
----------------------

New in version 3.10: See **PEP 597** for more details.

To find where the default locale encoding is used, you can enable the
"-X warn_default_encoding" command line option or set the
"PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING" environment variable, which will emit an
"EncodingWarning" when the default encoding is used.

If you are providing an API that uses "open()" or "TextIOWrapper" and
passes "encoding=None" as a parameter, you can use "text_encoding()"
so that callers of the API will emit an "EncodingWarning" if they
don’t pass an "encoding". However, please consider using UTF-8 by
default (i.e. "encoding="utf-8"") for new APIs.


High-level Module Interface
===========================

io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE                   *DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE..io.txt*

   An int containing the default buffer size used by the module’s
   buffered I/O classes.  "open()" uses the file’s blksize (as
   obtained by "os.stat()") if possible.

                                                      *open()..io.txt*
io.open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)

   This is an alias for the builtin "open()" function.

   This function raises an auditing event "open" with arguments
   _path_, _mode_ and _flags_. The _mode_ and _flags_ arguments may
   have been modified or inferred from the original call.

io.open_code(path)                               *open_code()..io.txt*

   Opens the provided file with mode "'rb'". This function should be
   used when the intent is to treat the contents as executable code.

   _path_ should be a "str" and an absolute path.

   The behavior of this function may be overridden by an earlier call
   to the "PyFile_SetOpenCodeHook()". However, assuming that _path_ is
   a "str" and an absolute path, "open_code(path)" should always
   behave the same as "open(path, 'rb')". Overriding the behavior is
   intended for additional validation or preprocessing of the file.

   New in version 3.8.

                                             *text_encoding()..io.txt*
io.text_encoding(encoding, stacklevel=2, /)

   This is a helper function for callables that use "open()" or
   "TextIOWrapper" and have an "encoding=None" parameter.

   This function returns _encoding_ if it is not "None". Otherwise, it
   returns ""locale"" or ""utf-8"" depending on UTF-8 Mode.

   This function emits an "EncodingWarning" if
   "sys.flags.warn_default_encoding" is true and _encoding_ is "None".
   _stacklevel_ specifies where the warning is emitted. For example:
>
      def read_text(path, encoding=None):
          encoding = io.text_encoding(encoding)  # stacklevel=2
          with open(path, encoding) as f:
              return f.read()
<
   In this example, an "EncodingWarning" is emitted for the caller of
   "read_text()".

   See Text Encoding for more information.

   New in version 3.10.

   Changed in version 3.11: "text_encoding()" returns “utf-8” when
   UTF-8 mode is enabled and _encoding_ is "None".

exception io.BlockingIOError                 *BlockingIOError..io.txt*

   This is a compatibility alias for the builtin "BlockingIOError"
   exception.

exception io.UnsupportedOperation       *UnsupportedOperation..io.txt*

   An exception inheriting "OSError" and "ValueError" that is raised
   when an unsupported operation is called on a stream.

See also:

  "sys"
     contains the standard IO streams: "sys.stdin", "sys.stdout", and
     "sys.stderr".


Class hierarchy
===============

The implementation of I/O streams is organized as a hierarchy of
classes.  First _abstract base classes_ (ABCs), which are used to
specify the various categories of streams, then concrete classes
providing the standard stream implementations.

   Note:

     The abstract base classes also provide default implementations of
     some methods in order to help implementation of concrete stream
     classes.  For example, "BufferedIOBase" provides unoptimized
     implementations of "readinto()" and "readline()".

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class "IOBase".
It defines the basic interface to a stream.  Note, however, that there
is no separation between reading and writing to streams;
implementations are allowed to raise "UnsupportedOperation" if they do
not support a given operation.

The "RawIOBase" ABC extends "IOBase".  It deals with the reading and
writing of bytes to a stream.  "FileIO" subclasses "RawIOBase" to
provide an interface to files in the machine’s file system.

The "BufferedIOBase" ABC extends "IOBase".  It deals with buffering on
a raw binary stream ("RawIOBase").  Its subclasses, "BufferedWriter",
"BufferedReader", and "BufferedRWPair" buffer raw binary streams that
are writable, readable, and both readable and writable, respectively.
"BufferedRandom" provides a buffered interface to seekable streams.
Another "BufferedIOBase" subclass, "BytesIO", is a stream of in-memory
bytes.

The "TextIOBase" ABC extends "IOBase".  It deals with streams whose
bytes represent text, and handles encoding and decoding to and from
strings.  "TextIOWrapper", which extends "TextIOBase", is a buffered
text interface to a buffered raw stream ("BufferedIOBase").  Finally,
"StringIO" is an in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the
arguments of "open()" are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

The following table summarizes the ABCs provided by the "io" module:

+---------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+


I/O Base Classes
----------------

class io.IOBase                                       *IOBase..io.txt*

   The abstract base class for all I/O classes.

   This class provides empty abstract implementations for many methods
   that derived classes can override selectively; the default
   implementations represent a file that cannot be read, written or
   seeked.

   Even though "IOBase" does not declare "read()" or "write()" because
   their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
   consider those methods part of the interface.  Also,
   implementations may raise a "ValueError" (or
   "UnsupportedOperation") when operations they do not support are
   called.

   The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file
   is "bytes".  Other _bytes-like objects_ are accepted as method
   arguments too.  Text I/O classes work with "str" data.

   Note that calling any method (even inquiries) on a closed stream is
   undefined.  Implementations may raise "ValueError" in this case.

   "IOBase" (and its subclasses) supports the iterator protocol,
   meaning that an "IOBase" object can be iterated over yielding the
   lines in a stream.  Lines are defined slightly differently
   depending on whether the stream is a binary stream (yielding
   bytes), or a text stream (yielding character strings).  See
   "readline()" below.

   "IOBase" is also a context manager and therefore supports the
   "with" statement.  In this example, _file_ is closed after the
   "with" statement’s suite is finished—even if an exception occurs:
>
      with open('spam.txt', 'w') as file:
          file.write('Spam and eggs!')
<
   "IOBase" provides these data attributes and methods:

   close()                                       *IOBase.close()..io.txt*

      Flush and close this stream. This method has no effect if the
      file is already closed. Once the file is closed, any operation
      on the file (e.g. reading or writing) will raise a "ValueError".

      As a convenience, it is allowed to call this method more than
      once; only the first call, however, will have an effect.

   closed                                         *IOBase.closed..io.txt*

      "True" if the stream is closed.

   fileno()                                     *IOBase.fileno()..io.txt*

      Return the underlying file descriptor (an integer) of the stream
      if it exists.  An "OSError" is raised if the IO object does not
      use a file descriptor.

   flush()                                       *IOBase.flush()..io.txt*

      Flush the write buffers of the stream if applicable.  This does
      nothing for read-only and non-blocking streams.

   isatty()                                     *IOBase.isatty()..io.txt*

      Return "True" if the stream is interactive (i.e., connected to a
      terminal/tty device).

   readable()                                 *IOBase.readable()..io.txt*

      Return "True" if the stream can be read from. If "False",
      "read()" will raise "OSError".

   readline(size=-1, /)                       *IOBase.readline()..io.txt*

      Read and return one line from the stream.  If _size_ is
      specified, at most _size_ bytes will be read.

      The line terminator is always "b'\n'" for binary files; for text
      files, the _newline_ argument to "open()" can be used to select
      the line terminator(s) recognized.

   readlines(hint=-1, /)                     *IOBase.readlines()..io.txt*

      Read and return a list of lines from the stream.  _hint_ can be
      specified to control the number of lines read: no more lines
      will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all
      lines so far exceeds _hint_.

      _hint_ values of "0" or less, as well as "None", are treated as
      no hint.

      Note that it’s already possible to iterate on file objects using
      "for line in file: ..." without calling "file.readlines()".

   seek(offset, whence=os.SEEK_SET, /)            *IOBase.seek()..io.txt*

      Change the stream position to the given byte _offset_,
      interpreted relative to the position indicated by _whence_, and
      return the new absolute position. Values for _whence_ are:

      * "os.SEEK_SET" or "0" – start of the stream (the default);
        _offset_ should be zero or positive

      * "os.SEEK_CUR" or "1" – current stream position; _offset_ may
        be negative

      * "os.SEEK_END" or "2" – end of the stream; _offset_ is usually
        negative

      New in version 3.1: The "SEEK_*" constants.

      New in version 3.3: Some operating systems could support
      additional values, like "os.SEEK_HOLE" or "os.SEEK_DATA". The
      valid values for a file could depend on it being open in text or
      binary mode.

   seekable()                                 *IOBase.seekable()..io.txt*

      Return "True" if the stream supports random access.  If "False",
      "seek()", "tell()" and "truncate()" will raise "OSError".

   tell()                                         *IOBase.tell()..io.txt*

      Return the current stream position.

   truncate(size=None, /)                     *IOBase.truncate()..io.txt*

      Resize the stream to the given _size_ in bytes (or the current
      position if _size_ is not specified).  The current stream
      position isn’t changed. This resizing can extend or reduce the
      current file size.  In case of extension, the contents of the
      new file area depend on the platform (on most systems,
      additional bytes are zero-filled).  The new file size is
      returned.

      Changed in version 3.5: Windows will now zero-fill files when
      extending.

   writable()                                 *IOBase.writable()..io.txt*

      Return "True" if the stream supports writing.  If "False",
      "write()" and "truncate()" will raise "OSError".

   writelines(lines, /)                     *IOBase.writelines()..io.txt*

      Write a list of lines to the stream.  Line separators are not
      added, so it is usual for each of the lines provided to have a
      line separator at the end.

   __del__()                                   *IOBase.__del__()..io.txt*

      Prepare for object destruction. "IOBase" provides a default
      implementation of this method that calls the instance’s
      "close()" method.

class io.RawIOBase                                 *RawIOBase..io.txt*

   Base class for raw binary streams.  It inherits "IOBase".

   Raw binary streams typically provide low-level access to an
   underlying OS device or API, and do not try to encapsulate it in
   high-level primitives (this functionality is done at a higher-level
   in buffered binary streams and text streams, described later in
   this page).

   "RawIOBase" provides these methods in addition to those from
   "IOBase":

   read(size=-1, /)                            *RawIOBase.read()..io.txt*

      Read up to _size_ bytes from the object and return them.  As a
      convenience, if _size_ is unspecified or -1, all bytes until EOF
      are returned. Otherwise, only one system call is ever made.
      Fewer than _size_ bytes may be returned if the operating system
      call returns fewer than _size_ bytes.

      If 0 bytes are returned, and _size_ was not 0, this indicates
      end of file. If the object is in non-blocking mode and no bytes
      are available, "None" is returned.

      The default implementation defers to "readall()" and
      "readinto()".

   readall()                                *RawIOBase.readall()..io.txt*

      Read and return all the bytes from the stream until EOF, using
      multiple calls to the stream if necessary.

   readinto(b, /)                          *RawIOBase.readinto()..io.txt*

      Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable _bytes-like object_
      _b_, and return the number of bytes read.  For example, _b_
      might be a "bytearray". If the object is in non-blocking mode
      and no bytes are available, "None" is returned.

   write(b, /)                                *RawIOBase.write()..io.txt*

      Write the given _bytes-like object_, _b_, to the underlying raw
      stream, and return the number of bytes written.  This can be
      less than the length of _b_ in bytes, depending on specifics of
      the underlying raw stream, and especially if it is in non-
      blocking mode.  "None" is returned if the raw stream is set not
      to block and no single byte could be readily written to it.  The
      caller may release or mutate _b_ after this method returns, so
      the implementation should only access _b_ during the method
      call.

class io.BufferedIOBase                       *BufferedIOBase..io.txt*

   Base class for binary streams that support some kind of buffering.
   It inherits "IOBase".

   The main difference with "RawIOBase" is that methods "read()",
   "readinto()" and "write()" will try (respectively) to read as much
   input as requested or to consume all given output, at the expense
   of making perhaps more than one system call.

   In addition, those methods can raise "BlockingIOError" if the
   underlying raw stream is in non-blocking mode and cannot take or
   give enough data; unlike their "RawIOBase" counterparts, they will
   never return "None".

   Besides, the "read()" method does not have a default implementation
   that defers to "readinto()".

   A typical "BufferedIOBase" implementation should not inherit from a
   "RawIOBase" implementation, but wrap one, like "BufferedWriter" and
   "BufferedReader" do.

   "BufferedIOBase" provides or overrides these data attributes and
   methods in addition to those from "IOBase":

   raw                                       *BufferedIOBase.raw..io.txt*

      The underlying raw stream (a "RawIOBase" instance) that
      "BufferedIOBase" deals with.  This is not part of the
      "BufferedIOBase" API and may not exist on some implementations.

   detach()                             *BufferedIOBase.detach()..io.txt*

      Separate the underlying raw stream from the buffer and return
      it.

      After the raw stream has been detached, the buffer is in an
      unusable state.

      Some buffers, like "BytesIO", do not have the concept of a
      single raw stream to return from this method.  They raise
      "UnsupportedOperation".

      New in version 3.1.

   read(size=-1, /)                       *BufferedIOBase.read()..io.txt*

      Read and return up to _size_ bytes.  If the argument is omitted,
      "None", or negative, data is read and returned until EOF is
      reached.  An empty "bytes" object is returned if the stream is
      already at EOF.

      If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is
      not interactive, multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy the
      byte count (unless EOF is reached first).  But for interactive
      raw streams, at most one raw read will be issued, and a short
      result does not imply that EOF is imminent.

      A "BlockingIOError" is raised if the underlying raw stream is in
      non blocking-mode, and has no data available at the moment.

   read1(size=-1, /)                     *BufferedIOBase.read1()..io.txt*

      Read and return up to _size_ bytes, with at most one call to the
      underlying raw stream’s "read()" (or "readinto()") method.  This
      can be useful if you are implementing your own buffering on top
      of a "BufferedIOBase" object.

      If _size_ is "-1" (the default), an arbitrary number of bytes
      are returned (more than zero unless EOF is reached).

   readinto(b, /)                     *BufferedIOBase.readinto()..io.txt*

      Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable _bytes-like object_
      _b_ and return the number of bytes read. For example, _b_ might
      be a "bytearray".

      Like "read()", multiple reads may be issued to the underlying
      raw stream, unless the latter is interactive.

      A "BlockingIOError" is raised if the underlying raw stream is in
      non blocking-mode, and has no data available at the moment.

   readinto1(b, /)                   *BufferedIOBase.readinto1()..io.txt*

      Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable _bytes-like object_
      _b_, using at most one call to the underlying raw stream’s
      "read()" (or "readinto()") method. Return the number of bytes
      read.

      A "BlockingIOError" is raised if the underlying raw stream is in
      non blocking-mode, and has no data available at the moment.

      New in version 3.5.

   write(b, /)                           *BufferedIOBase.write()..io.txt*

      Write the given _bytes-like object_, _b_, and return the number
      of bytes written (always equal to the length of _b_ in bytes,
      since if the write fails an "OSError" will be raised).
      Depending on the actual implementation, these bytes may be
      readily written to the underlying stream, or held in a buffer
      for performance and latency reasons.

      When in non-blocking mode, a "BlockingIOError" is raised if the
      data needed to be written to the raw stream but it couldn’t
      accept all the data without blocking.

      The caller may release or mutate _b_ after this method returns,
      so the implementation should only access _b_ during the method
      call.


Raw File I/O
------------

                                                      *FileIO..io.txt*
class io.FileIO(name, mode='r', closefd=True, opener=None)

   A raw binary stream representing an OS-level file containing bytes
   data.  It inherits "RawIOBase".

   The _name_ can be one of two things:

   * a character string or "bytes" object representing the path to the
     file which will be opened. In this case closefd must be "True"
     (the default) otherwise an error will be raised.

   * an integer representing the number of an existing OS-level file
     descriptor to which the resulting "FileIO" object will give
     access. When the FileIO object is closed this fd will be closed
     as well, unless _closefd_ is set to "False".

   The _mode_ can be "'r'", "'w'", "'x'" or "'a'" for reading
   (default), writing, exclusive creation or appending. The file will
   be created if it doesn’t exist when opened for writing or
   appending; it will be truncated when opened for writing.
   "FileExistsError" will be raised if it already exists when opened
   for creating. Opening a file for creating implies writing, so this
   mode behaves in a similar way to "'w'". Add a "'+'" to the mode to
   allow simultaneous reading and writing.

   The "read()" (when called with a positive argument), "readinto()"
   and "write()" methods on this class will only make one system call.

   A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as _opener_. The
   underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by
   calling _opener_ with (_name_, _flags_). _opener_ must return an
   open file descriptor (passing "os.open" as _opener_ results in
   functionality similar to passing "None").

   The newly created file is non-inheritable.

   See the "open()" built-in function for examples on using the
   _opener_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.3: The _opener_ parameter was added. The "'x'"
   mode was added.

   Changed in version 3.4: The file is now non-inheritable.

   "FileIO" provides these data attributes in addition to those from
   "RawIOBase" and "IOBase":

   mode                                             *FileIO.mode..io.txt*

      The mode as given in the constructor.

   name                                             *FileIO.name..io.txt*

      The file name.  This is the file descriptor of the file when no
      name is given in the constructor.


Buffered Streams
----------------

Buffered I/O streams provide a higher-level interface to an I/O device
than raw I/O does.

class io.BytesIO(initial_bytes=b'')                  *BytesIO..io.txt*

   A binary stream using an in-memory bytes buffer.  It inherits
   "BufferedIOBase".  The buffer is discarded when the "close()"
   method is called.

   The optional argument _initial_bytes_ is a _bytes-like object_ that
   contains initial data.

   "BytesIO" provides or overrides these methods in addition to those
   from "BufferedIOBase" and "IOBase":

   getbuffer()                              *BytesIO.getbuffer()..io.txt*

      Return a readable and writable view over the contents of the
      buffer without copying them.  Also, mutating the view will
      transparently update the contents of the buffer:
>
         >>> b = io.BytesIO(b"abcdef")
         >>> view = b.getbuffer()
         >>> view[2:4] = b"56"
         >>> b.getvalue()
         b'ab56ef'
<
      Note:

        As long as the view exists, the "BytesIO" object cannot be
        resized or closed.

      New in version 3.2.

   getvalue()                                *BytesIO.getvalue()..io.txt*

      Return "bytes" containing the entire contents of the buffer.

   read1(size=-1, /)                            *BytesIO.read1()..io.txt*

      In "BytesIO", this is the same as "read()".

      Changed in version 3.7: The _size_ argument is now optional.

   readinto1(b, /)                          *BytesIO.readinto1()..io.txt*

      In "BytesIO", this is the same as "readinto()".

      New in version 3.5.

                                              *BufferedReader..io.txt*
class io.BufferedReader(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)

   A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a
   readable, non seekable "RawIOBase" raw binary stream.  It inherits
   "BufferedIOBase".

   When reading data from this object, a larger amount of data may be
   requested from the underlying raw stream, and kept in an internal
   buffer. The buffered data can then be returned directly on
   subsequent reads.

   The constructor creates a "BufferedReader" for the given readable
   _raw_ stream and _buffer_size_.  If _buffer_size_ is omitted,
   "DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE" is used.

   "BufferedReader" provides or overrides these methods in addition to
   those from "BufferedIOBase" and "IOBase":

   peek(size=0, /)                        *BufferedReader.peek()..io.txt*

      Return bytes from the stream without advancing the position.  At
      most one single read on the raw stream is done to satisfy the
      call. The number of bytes returned may be less or more than
      requested.

   read(size=-1, /)                       *BufferedReader.read()..io.txt*

      Read and return _size_ bytes, or if _size_ is not given or
      negative, until EOF or if the read call would block in non-
      blocking mode.

   read1(size=-1, /)                     *BufferedReader.read1()..io.txt*

      Read and return up to _size_ bytes with only one call on the raw
      stream. If at least one byte is buffered, only buffered bytes
      are returned. Otherwise, one raw stream read call is made.

      Changed in version 3.7: The _size_ argument is now optional.

                                              *BufferedWriter..io.txt*
class io.BufferedWriter(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)

   A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a
   writeable, non seekable "RawIOBase" raw binary stream.  It inherits
   "BufferedIOBase".

   When writing to this object, data is normally placed into an
   internal buffer.  The buffer will be written out to the underlying
   "RawIOBase" object under various conditions, including:

   * when the buffer gets too small for all pending data;

   * when "flush()" is called;

   * when a "seek()" is requested (for "BufferedRandom" objects);

   * when the "BufferedWriter" object is closed or destroyed.

   The constructor creates a "BufferedWriter" for the given writeable
   _raw_ stream.  If the _buffer_size_ is not given, it defaults to
   "DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE".

   "BufferedWriter" provides or overrides these methods in addition to
   those from "BufferedIOBase" and "IOBase":

   flush()                               *BufferedWriter.flush()..io.txt*

      Force bytes held in the buffer into the raw stream.  A
      "BlockingIOError" should be raised if the raw stream blocks.

   write(b, /)                           *BufferedWriter.write()..io.txt*

      Write the _bytes-like object_, _b_, and return the number of
      bytes written.  When in non-blocking mode, a "BlockingIOError"
      is raised if the buffer needs to be written out but the raw
      stream blocks.

                                              *BufferedRandom..io.txt*
class io.BufferedRandom(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)

   A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a
   seekable "RawIOBase" raw binary stream.  It inherits
   "BufferedReader" and "BufferedWriter".

   The constructor creates a reader and writer for a seekable raw
   stream, given in the first argument.  If the _buffer_size_ is
   omitted it defaults to "DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE".

   "BufferedRandom" is capable of anything "BufferedReader" or
   "BufferedWriter" can do.  In addition, "seek()" and "tell()" are
   guaranteed to be implemented.

                                              *BufferedRWPair..io.txt*
class io.BufferedRWPair(reader, writer, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, /)

   A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to two non
   seekable "RawIOBase" raw binary streams—one readable, the other
   writeable. It inherits "BufferedIOBase".

   _reader_ and _writer_ are "RawIOBase" objects that are readable and
   writeable respectively.  If the _buffer_size_ is omitted it
   defaults to "DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE".

   "BufferedRWPair" implements all of "BufferedIOBase"'s methods
   except for "detach()", which raises "UnsupportedOperation".

   Warning:

     "BufferedRWPair" does not attempt to synchronize accesses to its
     underlying raw streams.  You should not pass it the same object
     as reader and writer; use "BufferedRandom" instead.


Text I/O
--------

class io.TextIOBase                               *TextIOBase..io.txt*

   Base class for text streams.  This class provides a character and
   line based interface to stream I/O.  It inherits "IOBase".

   "TextIOBase" provides or overrides these data attributes and
   methods in addition to those from "IOBase":

   encoding                                 *TextIOBase.encoding..io.txt*

      The name of the encoding used to decode the stream’s bytes into
      strings, and to encode strings into bytes.

   errors                                     *TextIOBase.errors..io.txt*

      The error setting of the decoder or encoder.

   newlines                                 *TextIOBase.newlines..io.txt*

      A string, a tuple of strings, or "None", indicating the newlines
      translated so far.  Depending on the implementation and the
      initial constructor flags, this may not be available.

   buffer                                     *TextIOBase.buffer..io.txt*

      The underlying binary buffer (a "BufferedIOBase" instance) that
      "TextIOBase" deals with.  This is not part of the "TextIOBase"
      API and may not exist in some implementations.

   detach()                                 *TextIOBase.detach()..io.txt*

      Separate the underlying binary buffer from the "TextIOBase" and
      return it.

      After the underlying buffer has been detached, the "TextIOBase"
      is in an unusable state.

      Some "TextIOBase" implementations, like "StringIO", may not have
      the concept of an underlying buffer and calling this method will
      raise "UnsupportedOperation".

      New in version 3.1.

   read(size=-1, /)                           *TextIOBase.read()..io.txt*

      Read and return at most _size_ characters from the stream as a
      single "str".  If _size_ is negative or "None", reads until EOF.

   readline(size=-1, /)                   *TextIOBase.readline()..io.txt*

      Read until newline or EOF and return a single "str".  If the
      stream is already at EOF, an empty string is returned.

      If _size_ is specified, at most _size_ characters will be read.

   seek(offset, whence=SEEK_SET, /)           *TextIOBase.seek()..io.txt*

      Change the stream position to the given _offset_.  Behaviour
      depends on the _whence_ parameter.  The default value for
      _whence_ is "SEEK_SET".

      * "SEEK_SET" or "0": seek from the start of the stream (the
        default); _offset_ must either be a number returned by
        "TextIOBase.tell()", or zero.  Any other _offset_ value
        produces undefined behaviour.

      * "SEEK_CUR" or "1": “seek” to the current position; _offset_
        must be zero, which is a no-operation (all other values are
        unsupported).

      * "SEEK_END" or "2": seek to the end of the stream; _offset_
        must be zero (all other values are unsupported).

      Return the new absolute position as an opaque number.

      New in version 3.1: The "SEEK_*" constants.

   tell()                                     *TextIOBase.tell()..io.txt*

      Return the current stream position as an opaque number.  The
      number does not usually represent a number of bytes in the
      underlying binary storage.

   write(s, /)                               *TextIOBase.write()..io.txt*

      Write the string _s_ to the stream and return the number of
      characters written.

                                               *TextIOWrapper..io.txt*
class io.TextIOWrapper(buffer, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, line_buffering=False, write_through=False)

   A buffered text stream providing higher-level access to a
   "BufferedIOBase" buffered binary stream.  It inherits "TextIOBase".

   _encoding_ gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be
   decoded or encoded with.  It defaults to "locale.getencoding()".
   "encoding="locale"" can be used to specify the current locale’s
   encoding explicitly. See Text Encoding for more information.

   _errors_ is an optional string that specifies how encoding and
   decoding errors are to be handled.  Pass "'strict'" to raise a
   "ValueError" exception if there is an encoding error (the default
   of "None" has the same effect), or pass "'ignore'" to ignore
   errors.  (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data
   loss.)  "'replace'" causes a replacement marker (such as "'?'") to
   be inserted where there is malformed data. "'backslashreplace'"
   causes malformed data to be replaced by a backslashed escape
   sequence.  When writing, "'xmlcharrefreplace'" (replace with the
   appropriate XML character reference)  or "'namereplace'" (replace
   with "\N{...}" escape sequences) can be used.  Any other error
   handling name that has been registered with
   "codecs.register_error()" is also valid.

   _newline_ controls how line endings are handled.  It can be "None",
   "''", "'\n'", "'\r'", and "'\r\n'".  It works as follows:

   * When reading input from the stream, if _newline_ is "None",
     _universal newlines_ mode is enabled.  Lines in the input can end
     in "'\n'", "'\r'", or "'\r\n'", and these are translated into
     "'\n'" before being returned to the caller.  If _newline_ is
     "''", universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are
     returned to the caller untranslated.  If _newline_ has any of the
     other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
     string, and the line ending is returned to the caller
     untranslated.

   * When writing output to the stream, if _newline_ is "None", any
     "'\n'" characters written are translated to the system default
     line separator, "os.linesep".  If _newline_ is "''" or "'\n'", no
     translation takes place.  If _newline_ is any of the other legal
     values, any "'\n'" characters written are translated to the given
     string.

   If _line_buffering_ is "True", "flush()" is implied when a call to
   write contains a newline character or a carriage return.

   If _write_through_ is "True", calls to "write()" are guaranteed not
   to be buffered: any data written on the "TextIOWrapper" object is
   immediately handled to its underlying binary _buffer_.

   Changed in version 3.3: The _write_through_ argument has been
   added.

   Changed in version 3.3: The default _encoding_ is now
   "locale.getpreferredencoding(False)" instead of
   "locale.getpreferredencoding()". Don’t change temporary the locale
   encoding using "locale.setlocale()", use the current locale
   encoding instead of the user preferred encoding.

   Changed in version 3.10: The _encoding_ argument now supports the
   ""locale"" dummy encoding name.

   "TextIOWrapper" provides these data attributes and methods in
   addition to those from "TextIOBase" and "IOBase":

   line_buffering                  *TextIOWrapper.line_buffering..io.txt*

      Whether line buffering is enabled.

   write_through                    *TextIOWrapper.write_through..io.txt*

      Whether writes are passed immediately to the underlying binary
      buffer.

      New in version 3.7.

                                 *TextIOWrapper.reconfigure()..io.txt*
   reconfigure(*, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, line_buffering=None, write_through=None)

      Reconfigure this text stream using new settings for _encoding_,
      _errors_, _newline_, _line_buffering_ and _write_through_.

      Parameters not specified keep current settings, except
      "errors='strict'" is used when _encoding_ is specified but
      _errors_ is not specified.

      It is not possible to change the encoding or newline if some
      data has already been read from the stream. On the other hand,
      changing encoding after write is possible.

      This method does an implicit stream flush before setting the new
      parameters.

      New in version 3.7.

      Changed in version 3.11: The method supports "encoding="locale""
      option.

   seek(cookie, whence=os.SEEK_SET, /)     *TextIOWrapper.seek()..io.txt*

      Set the stream position. Return the new stream position as an
      "int".

      Four operations are supported, given by the following argument
      combinations:

      * "seek(0, SEEK_SET)": Rewind to the start of the stream.

      * "seek(cookie, SEEK_SET)": Restore a previous position;
        _cookie_ **must be** a number returned by "tell()".

      * "seek(0, SEEK_END)": Fast-forward to the end of the stream.

      * "seek(0, SEEK_CUR)": Leave the current stream position
        unchanged.

      Any other argument combinations are invalid, and may raise
      exceptions.

      See also: "os.SEEK_SET", "os.SEEK_CUR", and "os.SEEK_END".

   tell()                                  *TextIOWrapper.tell()..io.txt*

      Return the stream position as an opaque number. The return value
      of "tell()" can be given as input to "seek()", to restore a
      previous stream position.

class io.StringIO(initial_value='', newline='\n')   *StringIO..io.txt*

   A text stream using an in-memory text buffer.  It inherits
   "TextIOBase".

   The text buffer is discarded when the "close()" method is called.

   The initial value of the buffer can be set by providing
   _initial_value_. If newline translation is enabled, newlines will
   be encoded as if by "write()".  The stream is positioned at the
   start of the buffer which emulates opening an existing file in a
   "w+" mode, making it ready for an immediate write from the
   beginning or for a write that would overwrite the initial value.
   To emulate opening a file in an "a+" mode ready for appending, use
   "f.seek(0, io.SEEK_END)" to reposition the stream at the end of the
   buffer.

   The _newline_ argument works like that of "TextIOWrapper", except
   that when writing output to the stream, if _newline_ is "None",
   newlines are written as "\n" on all platforms.

   "StringIO" provides this method in addition to those from
   "TextIOBase" and "IOBase":

   getvalue()                               *StringIO.getvalue()..io.txt*

      Return a "str" containing the entire contents of the buffer.
      Newlines are decoded as if by "read()", although the stream
      position is not changed.

   Example usage:
>
      import io

      output = io.StringIO()
      output.write('First line.\n')
      print('Second line.', file=output)

      # Retrieve file contents -- this will be
      # 'First line.\nSecond line.\n'
      contents = output.getvalue()

      # Close object and discard memory buffer --
      # .getvalue() will now raise an exception.
      output.close()
<

                                   *IncrementalNewlineDecoder..io.txt*
class io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder

   A helper codec that decodes newlines for _universal newlines_ mode.
   It inherits "codecs.IncrementalDecoder".


Performance
===========

This section discusses the performance of the provided concrete I/O
implementations.


Binary I/O
----------

By reading and writing only large chunks of data even when the user
asks for a single byte, buffered I/O hides any inefficiency in calling
and executing the operating system’s unbuffered I/O routines.  The
gain depends on the OS and the kind of I/O which is performed.  For
example, on some modern OSes such as Linux, unbuffered disk I/O can be
as fast as buffered I/O.  The bottom line, however, is that buffered
I/O offers predictable performance regardless of the platform and the
backing device.  Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use
buffered I/O rather than unbuffered I/O for binary data.


Text I/O
--------

Text I/O over a binary storage (such as a file) is significantly
slower than binary I/O over the same storage, because it requires
conversions between unicode and binary data using a character codec.
This can become noticeable handling huge amounts of text data like
large log files.  Also, "tell()" and "seek()" are both quite slow due
to the reconstruction algorithm used.

"StringIO", however, is a native in-memory unicode container and will
exhibit similar speed to "BytesIO".


Multi-threading
---------------

"FileIO" objects are thread-safe to the extent that the operating
system calls (such as _read(2)_ under Unix) they wrap are thread-safe
too.

Binary buffered objects (instances of "BufferedReader",
"BufferedWriter", "BufferedRandom" and "BufferedRWPair") protect their
internal structures using a lock; it is therefore safe to call them
from multiple threads at once.

"TextIOWrapper" objects are not thread-safe.


Reentrancy
----------

Binary buffered objects (instances of "BufferedReader",
"BufferedWriter", "BufferedRandom" and "BufferedRWPair") are not
reentrant.  While reentrant calls will not happen in normal
situations, they can arise from doing I/O in a "signal" handler.  If a
thread tries to re-enter a buffered object which it is already
accessing, a "RuntimeError" is raised.  Note this doesn’t prohibit a
different thread from entering the buffered object.

The above implicitly extends to text files, since the "open()"
function will wrap a buffered object inside a "TextIOWrapper".  This
includes standard streams and therefore affects the built-in "print()"
function as well.
