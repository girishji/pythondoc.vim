======================================================================

The following useful handlers are provided in the package. Note that
three of the handlers ("StreamHandler", "FileHandler" and
"NullHandler") are actually defined in the "logging" module itself,
but have been documented here along with the other handlers.


StreamHandler
=============

The "StreamHandler" class, located in the core "logging" package,
sends logging output to streams such as _sys.stdout_, _sys.stderr_ or
any file-like object (or, more precisely, any object which supports
"write()" and "flush()" methods).

                                 *StreamHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.StreamHandler(stream=None)

   Returns a new instance of the "StreamHandler" class. If _stream_ is
   specified, the instance will use it for logging output; otherwise,
   _sys.stderr_ will be used.

   emit(record)              *StreamHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record.
      The record is then written to the stream followed by
      "terminator". If exception information is present, it is
      formatted using "traceback.print_exception()" and appended to
      the stream.

   flush()                  *StreamHandler.flush()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Flushes the stream by calling its "flush()" method. Note that
      the "close()" method is inherited from "Handler" and so does no
      output, so an explicit "flush()" call may be needed at times.

   setStream(stream)    *StreamHandler.setStream()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Sets the instance’s stream to the specified value, if it is
      different. The old stream is flushed before the new stream is
      set.

      Parameters:
         **stream** – The stream that the handler should use.

      Returns:
         the old stream, if the stream was changed, or _None_ if it
         wasn’t.

      New in version 3.7.

   terminator            *StreamHandler.terminator..logging.handlers.txt*

      String used as the terminator when writing a formatted record to
      a stream. Default value is "'\n'".

      If you don’t want a newline termination, you can set the handler
      instance’s "terminator" attribute to the empty string.

      In earlier versions, the terminator was hardcoded as "'\n'".

      New in version 3.2.


FileHandler
===========

The "FileHandler" class, located in the core "logging" package, sends
logging output to a disk file.  It inherits the output functionality
from "StreamHandler".

                                   *FileHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.FileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False, errors=None)

   Returns a new instance of the "FileHandler" class. The specified
   file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If _mode_ is not
   specified, "'a'" is used.  If _encoding_ is not "None", it is used
   to open the file with that encoding.  If _delay_ is true, then file
   opening is deferred until the first call to "emit()". By default,
   the file grows indefinitely. If _errors_ is specified, it’s used to
   determine how encoding errors are handled.

   Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, "Path" objects
   are also accepted for the _filename_ argument.

   Changed in version 3.9: The _errors_ parameter was added.

   close()                    *FileHandler.close()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Closes the file.

   emit(record)                *FileHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Outputs the record to the file.

      Note that if the file was closed due to logging shutdown at exit
      and the file mode is ‘w’, the record will not be emitted (see
      bpo-42378).


NullHandler
===========

New in version 3.1.

The "NullHandler" class, located in the core "logging" package, does
not do any formatting or output. It is essentially a ‘no-op’ handler
for use by library developers.

class logging.NullHandler          *NullHandler..logging.handlers.txt*

   Returns a new instance of the "NullHandler" class.

   emit(record)                *NullHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      This method does nothing.

   handle(record)            *NullHandler.handle()..logging.handlers.txt*

      This method does nothing.

   createLock()          *NullHandler.createLock()..logging.handlers.txt*

      This method returns "None" for the lock, since there is no
      underlying I/O to which access needs to be serialized.

See Configuring Logging for a Library for more information on how to
use "NullHandler".


WatchedFileHandler
==================

The "WatchedFileHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers"
module, is a "FileHandler" which watches the file it is logging to. If
the file changes, it is closed and reopened using the file name.

A file change can happen because of usage of programs such as
_newsyslog_ and _logrotate_ which perform log file rotation. This
handler, intended for use under Unix/Linux, watches the file to see if
it has changed since the last emit. (A file is deemed to have changed
if its device or inode have changed.) If the file has changed, the old
file stream is closed, and the file opened to get a new stream.

This handler is not appropriate for use under Windows, because under
Windows open log files cannot be moved or renamed - logging opens the
files with exclusive locks - and so there is no need for such a
handler. Furthermore, _ST_INO_ is not supported under Windows;
"stat()" always returns zero for this value.

                            *WatchedFileHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False, errors=None)

   Returns a new instance of the "WatchedFileHandler" class. The
   specified file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If
   _mode_ is not specified, "'a'" is used.  If _encoding_ is not
   "None", it is used to open the file with that encoding.  If _delay_
   is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call to
   "emit()".  By default, the file grows indefinitely. If _errors_ is
   provided, it determines how encoding errors are handled.

   Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, "Path" objects
   are also accepted for the _filename_ argument.

   Changed in version 3.9: The _errors_ parameter was added.

           *WatchedFileHandler.reopenIfNeeded()..logging.handlers.txt*
   reopenIfNeeded()

      Checks to see if the file has changed.  If it has, the existing
      stream is flushed and closed and the file opened again,
      typically as a precursor to outputting the record to the file.

      New in version 3.6.

   emit(record)         *WatchedFileHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Outputs the record to the file, but first calls
      "reopenIfNeeded()" to reopen the file if it has changed.


BaseRotatingHandler
===================

The "BaseRotatingHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers"
module, is the base class for the rotating file handlers,
"RotatingFileHandler" and "TimedRotatingFileHandler". You should not
need to instantiate this class, but it has attributes and methods you
may need to override.

                           *BaseRotatingHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler(filename, mode, encoding=None, delay=False, errors=None)

   The parameters are as for "FileHandler". The attributes are:

   namer                *BaseRotatingHandler.namer..logging.handlers.txt*

      If this attribute is set to a callable, the
      "rotation_filename()" method delegates to this callable. The
      parameters passed to the callable are those passed to
      "rotation_filename()".

      Note:

        The namer function is called quite a few times during
        rollover, so it should be as simple and as fast as possible.
        It should also return the same output every time for a given
        input, otherwise the rollover behaviour may not work as
        expected.It’s also worth noting that care should be taken when
        using a namer to preserve certain attributes in the filename
        which are used during rotation. For example,
        "RotatingFileHandler" expects to have a set of log files whose
        names contain successive integers, so that rotation works as
        expected, and "TimedRotatingFileHandler" deletes old log files
        (based on the "backupCount" parameter passed to the handler’s
        initializer) by determining the oldest files to delete. For
        this to happen, the filenames should be sortable using the
        date/time portion of the filename, and a namer needs to
        respect this. (If a namer is wanted that doesn’t respect this
        scheme, it will need to be used in a subclass of
        "TimedRotatingFileHandler" which overrides the
        "getFilesToDelete()" method to fit in with the custom naming
        scheme.)

      New in version 3.3.

   rotator            *BaseRotatingHandler.rotator..logging.handlers.txt*

      If this attribute is set to a callable, the "rotate()" method
      delegates to this callable.  The parameters passed to the
      callable are those passed to "rotate()".

      New in version 3.3.

       *BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename()..logging.handlers.txt*
   rotation_filename(default_name)

      Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.

      This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.

      The default implementation calls the ‘namer’ attribute of the
      handler, if it’s callable, passing the default name to it. If
      the attribute isn’t callable (the default is "None"), the name
      is returned unchanged.

      Parameters:
         **default_name** – The default name for the log file.

      New in version 3.3.

                  *BaseRotatingHandler.rotate()..logging.handlers.txt*
   rotate(source, dest)

      When rotating, rotate the current log.

      The default implementation calls the ‘rotator’ attribute of the
      handler, if it’s callable, passing the source and dest arguments
      to it. If the attribute isn’t callable (the default is "None"),
      the source is simply renamed to the destination.

      Parameters:
         * **source** – The source filename. This is normally the base
           filename, e.g. ‘test.log’.

         * **dest** – The destination filename. This is normally what
           the source is rotated to, e.g. ‘test.log.1’.

      New in version 3.3.

The reason the attributes exist is to save you having to subclass -
you can use the same callables for instances of "RotatingFileHandler"
and "TimedRotatingFileHandler". If either the namer or rotator
callable raises an exception, this will be handled in the same way as
any other exception during an "emit()" call, i.e. via the
"handleError()" method of the handler.

If you need to make more significant changes to rotation processing,
you can override the methods.

For an example, see Using a rotator and namer to customize log
rotation processing.


RotatingFileHandler
===================

The "RotatingFileHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers"
module, supports rotation of disk log files.

                           *RotatingFileHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(filename, mode='a', maxBytes=0, backupCount=0, encoding=None, delay=False, errors=None)

   Returns a new instance of the "RotatingFileHandler" class. The
   specified file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If
   _mode_ is not specified, "'a'" is used.  If _encoding_ is not
   "None", it is used to open the file with that encoding.  If _delay_
   is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call to
   "emit()".  By default, the file grows indefinitely. If _errors_ is
   provided, it determines how encoding errors are handled.

   You can use the _maxBytes_ and _backupCount_ values to allow the
   file to _rollover_ at a predetermined size. When the size is about
   to be exceeded, the file is closed and a new file is silently
   opened for output. Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is
   nearly _maxBytes_ in length; but if either of _maxBytes_ or
   _backupCount_ is zero, rollover never occurs, so you generally want
   to set _backupCount_ to at least 1, and have a non-zero _maxBytes_.
   When _backupCount_ is non-zero, the system will save old log files
   by appending the extensions ‘.1’, ‘.2’ etc., to the filename. For
   example, with a _backupCount_ of 5 and a base file name of
   "app.log", you would get "app.log", "app.log.1", "app.log.2", up to
   "app.log.5". The file being written to is always "app.log".  When
   this file is filled, it is closed and renamed to "app.log.1", and
   if files "app.log.1", "app.log.2", etc. exist, then they are
   renamed to "app.log.2", "app.log.3" etc. respectively.

   Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, "Path" objects
   are also accepted for the _filename_ argument.

   Changed in version 3.9: The _errors_ parameter was added.

              *RotatingFileHandler.doRollover()..logging.handlers.txt*
   doRollover()

      Does a rollover, as described above.

   emit(record)        *RotatingFileHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Outputs the record to the file, catering for rollover as
      described previously.


TimedRotatingFileHandler
========================

The "TimedRotatingFileHandler" class, located in the
"logging.handlers" module, supports rotation of disk log files at
certain timed intervals.

                      *TimedRotatingFileHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler(filename, when='h', interval=1, backupCount=0, encoding=None, delay=False, utc=False, atTime=None, errors=None)

   Returns a new instance of the "TimedRotatingFileHandler" class. The
   specified file is opened and used as the stream for logging. On
   rotating it also sets the filename suffix. Rotating happens based
   on the product of _when_ and _interval_.

   You can use the _when_ to specify the type of _interval_. The list
   of possible values is below.  Note that they are not case
   sensitive.

   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
   | Value            | Type of interval             | If/how _atTime_ is used   |
   |==================|==============================|===========================|
   | "'S'"            | Seconds                      | Ignored                   |
   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
   | "'M'"            | Minutes                      | Ignored                   |
   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
   | "'H'"            | Hours                        | Ignored                   |
   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
   | "'D'"            | Days                         | Ignored                   |
   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
   | "'W0'-'W6'"      | Weekday (0=Monday)           | Used to compute initial   |
   |                  |                              | rollover time             |
   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
   | "'midnight'"     | Roll over at midnight, if    | Used to compute initial   |
   |                  | _atTime_ not specified, else | rollover time             |
   |                  | at time _atTime_             |                           |
   +------------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+

   When using weekday-based rotation, specify ‘W0’ for Monday, ‘W1’
   for Tuesday, and so on up to ‘W6’ for Sunday. In this case, the
   value passed for _interval_ isn’t used.

   The system will save old log files by appending extensions to the
   filename. The extensions are date-and-time based, using the
   strftime format "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S" or a leading portion thereof,
   depending on the rollover interval.

   When computing the next rollover time for the first time (when the
   handler is created), the last modification time of an existing log
   file, or else the current time, is used to compute when the next
   rotation will occur.

   If the _utc_ argument is true, times in UTC will be used; otherwise
   local time is used.

   If _backupCount_ is nonzero, at most _backupCount_ files will be
   kept, and if more would be created when rollover occurs, the oldest
   one is deleted. The deletion logic uses the interval to determine
   which files to delete, so changing the interval may leave old files
   lying around.

   If _delay_ is true, then file opening is deferred until the first
   call to "emit()".

   If _atTime_ is not "None", it must be a "datetime.time" instance
   which specifies the time of day when rollover occurs, for the cases
   where rollover is set to happen “at midnight” or “on a particular
   weekday”. Note that in these cases, the _atTime_ value is
   effectively used to compute the _initial_ rollover, and subsequent
   rollovers would be calculated via the normal interval calculation.

   If _errors_ is specified, it’s used to determine how encoding
   errors are handled.

   Note:

     Calculation of the initial rollover time is done when the handler
     is initialised. Calculation of subsequent rollover times is done
     only when rollover occurs, and rollover occurs only when emitting
     output. If this is not kept in mind, it might lead to some
     confusion. For example, if an interval of “every minute” is set,
     that does not mean you will always see log files with times (in
     the filename) separated by a minute; if, during application
     execution, logging output is generated more frequently than once
     a minute, _then_ you can expect to see log files with times
     separated by a minute. If, on the other hand, logging messages
     are only output once every five minutes (say), then there will be
     gaps in the file times corresponding to the minutes where no
     output (and hence no rollover) occurred.

   Changed in version 3.4: _atTime_ parameter was added.

   Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, "Path" objects
   are also accepted for the _filename_ argument.

   Changed in version 3.9: The _errors_ parameter was added.

         *TimedRotatingFileHandler.doRollover()..logging.handlers.txt*
   doRollover()

      Does a rollover, as described above.

   emit(record)   *TimedRotatingFileHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Outputs the record to the file, catering for rollover as
      described above.

   *TimedRotatingFileHandler.getFilesToDelete()..logging.handlers.txt*
   getFilesToDelete()

      Returns a list of filenames which should be deleted as part of
      rollover. These are the absolute paths of the oldest backup log
      files written by the handler.


SocketHandler
=============

The "SocketHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
sends logging output to a network socket. The base class uses a TCP
socket.

                                 *SocketHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.SocketHandler(host, port)

   Returns a new instance of the "SocketHandler" class intended to
   communicate with a remote machine whose address is given by _host_
   and _port_.

   Changed in version 3.4: If "port" is specified as "None", a Unix
   domain socket is created using the value in "host" - otherwise, a
   TCP socket is created.

   close()                  *SocketHandler.close()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Closes the socket.

   emit()                    *SocketHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary and writes it to the
      socket in binary format. If there is an error with the socket,
      silently drops the packet. If the connection was previously
      lost, re-establishes the connection. To unpickle the record at
      the receiving end into a "LogRecord", use the "makeLogRecord()"
      function.

   handleError()      *SocketHandler.handleError()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Handles an error which has occurred during "emit()". The most
      likely cause is a lost connection. Closes the socket so that we
      can retry on the next event.

   makeSocket()        *SocketHandler.makeSocket()..logging.handlers.txt*

      This is a factory method which allows subclasses to define the
      precise type of socket they want. The default implementation
      creates a TCP socket ("socket.SOCK_STREAM").

                    *SocketHandler.makePickle()..logging.handlers.txt*
   makePickle(record)

      Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary in binary format with
      a length prefix, and returns it ready for transmission across
      the socket. The details of this operation are equivalent to:
>
         data = pickle.dumps(record_attr_dict, 1)
         datalen = struct.pack('>L', len(data))
         return datalen + data
<
      Note that pickles aren’t completely secure. If you are concerned
      about security, you may want to override this method to
      implement a more secure mechanism. For example, you can sign
      pickles using HMAC and then verify them on the receiving end, or
      alternatively you can disable unpickling of global objects on
      the receiving end.

   send(packet)              *SocketHandler.send()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Send a pickled byte-string _packet_ to the socket. The format of
      the sent byte-string is as described in the documentation for
      "makePickle()".

      This function allows for partial sends, which can happen when
      the network is busy.

   createSocket()    *SocketHandler.createSocket()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Tries to create a socket; on failure, uses an exponential back-
      off algorithm.  On initial failure, the handler will drop the
      message it was trying to send.  When subsequent messages are
      handled by the same instance, it will not try connecting until
      some time has passed.  The default parameters are such that the
      initial delay is one second, and if after that delay the
      connection still can’t be made, the handler will double the
      delay each time up to a maximum of 30 seconds.

      This behaviour is controlled by the following handler
      attributes:

      * "retryStart" (initial delay, defaulting to 1.0 seconds).

      * "retryFactor" (multiplier, defaulting to 2.0).

      * "retryMax" (maximum delay, defaulting to 30.0 seconds).

      This means that if the remote listener starts up _after_ the
      handler has been used, you could lose messages (since the
      handler won’t even attempt a connection until the delay has
      elapsed, but just silently drop messages during the delay
      period).


DatagramHandler
===============

The "DatagramHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
inherits from "SocketHandler" to support sending logging messages over
UDP sockets.

                               *DatagramHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.DatagramHandler(host, port)

   Returns a new instance of the "DatagramHandler" class intended to
   communicate with a remote machine whose address is given by _host_
   and _port_.

   Note:

     As UDP is not a streaming protocol, there is no persistent
     connection between an instance of this handler and _host_. For
     this reason, when using a network socket, a DNS lookup might have
     to be made each time an event is logged, which can introduce some
     latency into the system. If this affects you, you can do a lookup
     yourself and initialize this handler using the looked-up IP
     address rather than the hostname.

   Changed in version 3.4: If "port" is specified as "None", a Unix
   domain socket is created using the value in "host" - otherwise, a
   UDP socket is created.

   emit()                  *DatagramHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary and writes it to the
      socket in binary format. If there is an error with the socket,
      silently drops the packet. To unpickle the record at the
      receiving end into a "LogRecord", use the "makeLogRecord()"
      function.

   makeSocket()      *DatagramHandler.makeSocket()..logging.handlers.txt*

      The factory method of "SocketHandler" is here overridden to
      create a UDP socket ("socket.SOCK_DGRAM").

   send(s)                 *DatagramHandler.send()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Send a pickled byte-string to a socket. The format of the sent
      byte-string is as described in the documentation for
      "SocketHandler.makePickle()".


SysLogHandler
=============

The "SysLogHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
supports sending logging messages to a remote or local Unix syslog.

                                 *SysLogHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address=('localhost', SYSLOG_UDP_PORT), facility=LOG_USER, socktype=socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

   Returns a new instance of the "SysLogHandler" class intended to
   communicate with a remote Unix machine whose address is given by
   _address_ in the form of a "(host, port)" tuple.  If _address_ is
   not specified, "('localhost', 514)" is used.  The address is used
   to open a socket.  An alternative to providing a "(host, port)"
   tuple is providing an address as a string, for example ‘/dev/log’.
   In this case, a Unix domain socket is used to send the message to
   the syslog. If _facility_ is not specified, "LOG_USER" is used. The
   type of socket opened depends on the _socktype_ argument, which
   defaults to "socket.SOCK_DGRAM" and thus opens a UDP socket. To
   open a TCP socket (for use with the newer syslog daemons such as
   rsyslog), specify a value of "socket.SOCK_STREAM".

   Note that if your server is not listening on UDP port 514,
   "SysLogHandler" may appear not to work. In that case, check what
   address you should be using for a domain socket - it’s system
   dependent. For example, on Linux it’s usually ‘/dev/log’ but on
   OS/X it’s ‘/var/run/syslog’. You’ll need to check your platform and
   use the appropriate address (you may need to do this check at
   runtime if your application needs to run on several platforms). On
   Windows, you pretty much have to use the UDP option.

   Note:

     On macOS 12.x (Monterey), Apple has changed the behaviour of
     their syslog daemon - it no longer listens on a domain socket.
     Therefore, you cannot expect "SysLogHandler" to work on this
     system.See gh-91070 for more information.

   Changed in version 3.2: _socktype_ was added.

   close()                  *SysLogHandler.close()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Closes the socket to the remote host.

   createSocket()    *SysLogHandler.createSocket()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Tries to create a socket and, if it’s not a datagram socket,
      connect it to the other end. This method is called during
      handler initialization, but it’s not regarded as an error if the
      other end isn’t listening at this point - the method will be
      called again when emitting an event, if but it’s not regarded as
      an error if the other end isn’t listening yet — the method will
      be called again when emitting an event, if there is no socket at
      that point.

      New in version 3.11.

   emit(record)              *SysLogHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      The record is formatted, and then sent to the syslog server. If
      exception information is present, it is _not_ sent to the
      server.

      Changed in version 3.2.1: (See: bpo-12168.) In earlier versions,
      the message sent to the syslog daemons was always terminated
      with a NUL byte, because early versions of these daemons
      expected a NUL terminated message - even though it’s not in the
      relevant specification (**RFC 5424**). More recent versions of
      these daemons don’t expect the NUL byte but strip it off if it’s
      there, and even more recent daemons (which adhere more closely
      to RFC 5424) pass the NUL byte on as part of the message.To
      enable easier handling of syslog messages in the face of all
      these differing daemon behaviours, the appending of the NUL byte
      has been made configurable, through the use of a class-level
      attribute, "append_nul". This defaults to "True" (preserving the
      existing behaviour) but can be set to "False" on a
      "SysLogHandler" instance in order for that instance to _not_
      append the NUL terminator.

      Changed in version 3.3: (See: bpo-12419.) In earlier versions,
      there was no facility for an “ident” or “tag” prefix to identify
      the source of the message. This can now be specified using a
      class-level attribute, defaulting to """" to preserve existing
      behaviour, but which can be overridden on a "SysLogHandler"
      instance in order for that instance to prepend the ident to
      every message handled. Note that the provided ident must be
      text, not bytes, and is prepended to the message exactly as is.

                *SysLogHandler.encodePriority()..logging.handlers.txt*
   encodePriority(facility, priority)

      Encodes the facility and priority into an integer. You can pass
      in strings or integers - if strings are passed, internal mapping
      dictionaries are used to convert them to integers.

      The symbolic "LOG_" values are defined in "SysLogHandler" and
      mirror the values defined in the "sys/syslog.h" header file.

                   *SysLogHandler.mapPriority()..logging.handlers.txt*
   mapPriority(levelname)

      Maps a logging level name to a syslog priority name. You may
      need to override this if you are using custom levels, or if the
      default algorithm is not suitable for your needs. The default
      algorithm maps "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR" and
      "CRITICAL" to the equivalent syslog names, and all other level
      names to ‘warning’.


NTEventLogHandler
=================

The "NTEventLogHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers"
module, supports sending logging messages to a local Windows NT,
Windows 2000 or Windows XP event log. Before you can use it, you need
Mark Hammond’s Win32 extensions for Python installed.

                             *NTEventLogHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.NTEventLogHandler(appname, dllname=None, logtype='Application')

   Returns a new instance of the "NTEventLogHandler" class. The
   _appname_ is used to define the application name as it appears in
   the event log. An appropriate registry entry is created using this
   name. The _dllname_ should give the fully qualified pathname of a
   .dll or .exe which contains message definitions to hold in the log
   (if not specified, "'win32service.pyd'" is used - this is installed
   with the Win32 extensions and contains some basic placeholder
   message definitions. Note that use of these placeholders will make
   your event logs big, as the entire message source is held in the
   log. If you want slimmer logs, you have to pass in the name of your
   own .dll or .exe which contains the message definitions you want to
   use in the event log). The _logtype_ is one of "'Application'",
   "'System'" or "'Security'", and defaults to "'Application'".

   close()              *NTEventLogHandler.close()..logging.handlers.txt*

      At this point, you can remove the application name from the
      registry as a source of event log entries. However, if you do
      this, you will not be able to see the events as you intended in
      the Event Log Viewer - it needs to be able to access the
      registry to get the .dll name. The current version does not do
      this.

   emit(record)          *NTEventLogHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Determines the message ID, event category and event type, and
      then logs the message in the NT event log.

          *NTEventLogHandler.getEventCategory()..logging.handlers.txt*
   getEventCategory(record)

      Returns the event category for the record. Override this if you
      want to specify your own categories. This version returns 0.

              *NTEventLogHandler.getEventType()..logging.handlers.txt*
   getEventType(record)

      Returns the event type for the record. Override this if you want
      to specify your own types. This version does a mapping using the
      handler’s typemap attribute, which is set up in "__init__()" to
      a dictionary which contains mappings for "DEBUG", "INFO",
      "WARNING", "ERROR" and "CRITICAL". If you are using your own
      levels, you will either need to override this method or place a
      suitable dictionary in the handler’s _typemap_ attribute.

              *NTEventLogHandler.getMessageID()..logging.handlers.txt*
   getMessageID(record)

      Returns the message ID for the record. If you are using your own
      messages, you could do this by having the _msg_ passed to the
      logger being an ID rather than a format string. Then, in here,
      you could use a dictionary lookup to get the message ID. This
      version returns 1, which is the base message ID in
      "win32service.pyd".


SMTPHandler
===========

The "SMTPHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
supports sending logging messages to an email address via SMTP.

                                   *SMTPHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.SMTPHandler(mailhost, fromaddr, toaddrs, subject, credentials=None, secure=None, timeout=1.0)

   Returns a new instance of the "SMTPHandler" class. The instance is
   initialized with the from and to addresses and subject line of the
   email. The _toaddrs_ should be a list of strings. To specify a non-
   standard SMTP port, use the (host, port) tuple format for the
   _mailhost_ argument. If you use a string, the standard SMTP port is
   used. If your SMTP server requires authentication, you can specify
   a (username, password) tuple for the _credentials_ argument.

   To specify the use of a secure protocol (TLS), pass in a tuple to
   the _secure_ argument. This will only be used when authentication
   credentials are supplied. The tuple should be either an empty
   tuple, or a single-value tuple with the name of a keyfile, or a
   2-value tuple with the names of the keyfile and certificate file.
   (This tuple is passed to the "smtplib.SMTP.starttls()" method.)

   A timeout can be specified for communication with the SMTP server
   using the _timeout_ argument.

   New in version 3.3: The _timeout_ argument was added.

   emit(record)                *SMTPHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Formats the record and sends it to the specified addressees.

   getSubject(record)    *SMTPHandler.getSubject()..logging.handlers.txt*

      If you want to specify a subject line which is record-dependent,
      override this method.


MemoryHandler
=============

The "MemoryHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
supports buffering of logging records in memory, periodically flushing
them to a _target_ handler. Flushing occurs whenever the buffer is
full, or when an event of a certain severity or greater is seen.

"MemoryHandler" is a subclass of the more general "BufferingHandler",
which is an abstract class. This buffers logging records in memory.
Whenever each record is added to the buffer, a check is made by
calling "shouldFlush()" to see if the buffer should be flushed.  If it
should, then "flush()" is expected to do the flushing.

                              *BufferingHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.BufferingHandler(capacity)

   Initializes the handler with a buffer of the specified capacity.
   Here, _capacity_ means the number of logging records buffered.

   emit(record)           *BufferingHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Append the record to the buffer. If "shouldFlush()" returns
      true, call "flush()" to process the buffer.

   flush()               *BufferingHandler.flush()..logging.handlers.txt*

      For a "BufferingHandler" instance, flushing means that it sets
      the buffer to an empty list. This method can be overwritten to
      implement more useful flushing behavior.

                *BufferingHandler.shouldFlush()..logging.handlers.txt*
   shouldFlush(record)

      Return "True" if the buffer is up to capacity. This method can
      be overridden to implement custom flushing strategies.

                                 *MemoryHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.MemoryHandler(capacity, flushLevel=ERROR, target=None, flushOnClose=True)

   Returns a new instance of the "MemoryHandler" class. The instance
   is initialized with a buffer size of _capacity_ (number of records
   buffered). If _flushLevel_ is not specified, "ERROR" is used. If no
   _target_ is specified, the target will need to be set using
   "setTarget()" before this handler does anything useful. If
   _flushOnClose_ is specified as "False", then the buffer is _not_
   flushed when the handler is closed. If not specified or specified
   as "True", the previous behaviour of flushing the buffer will occur
   when the handler is closed.

   Changed in version 3.6: The _flushOnClose_ parameter was added.

   close()                  *MemoryHandler.close()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Calls "flush()", sets the target to "None" and clears the
      buffer.

   flush()                  *MemoryHandler.flush()..logging.handlers.txt*

      For a "MemoryHandler" instance, flushing means just sending the
      buffered records to the target, if there is one. The buffer is
      also cleared when buffered records are sent to the target.
      Override if you want different behavior.

   setTarget(target)    *MemoryHandler.setTarget()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Sets the target handler for this handler.

                   *MemoryHandler.shouldFlush()..logging.handlers.txt*
   shouldFlush(record)

      Checks for buffer full or a record at the _flushLevel_ or
      higher.


HTTPHandler
===========

The "HTTPHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
supports sending logging messages to a web server, using either "GET"
or "POST" semantics.

                                   *HTTPHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.HTTPHandler(host, url, method='GET', secure=False, credentials=None, context=None)

   Returns a new instance of the "HTTPHandler" class. The _host_ can
   be of the form "host:port", should you need to use a specific port
   number.  If no _method_ is specified, "GET" is used. If _secure_ is
   true, a HTTPS connection will be used. The _context_ parameter may
   be set to a "ssl.SSLContext" instance to configure the SSL settings
   used for the HTTPS connection. If _credentials_ is specified, it
   should be a 2-tuple consisting of userid and password, which will
   be placed in a HTTP ‘Authorization’ header using Basic
   authentication. If you specify credentials, you should also specify
   secure=True so that your userid and password are not passed in
   cleartext across the wire.

   Changed in version 3.5: The _context_ parameter was added.

                    *HTTPHandler.mapLogRecord()..logging.handlers.txt*
   mapLogRecord(record)

      Provides a dictionary, based on "record", which is to be URL-
      encoded and sent to the web server. The default implementation
      just returns "record.__dict__". This method can be overridden if
      e.g. only a subset of "LogRecord" is to be sent to the web
      server, or if more specific customization of what’s sent to the
      server is required.

   emit(record)                *HTTPHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Sends the record to the web server as a URL-encoded dictionary.
      The "mapLogRecord()" method is used to convert the record to the
      dictionary to be sent.

   Note:

     Since preparing a record for sending it to a web server is not
     the same as a generic formatting operation, using
     "setFormatter()" to specify a "Formatter" for a "HTTPHandler" has
     no effect. Instead of calling "format()", this handler calls
     "mapLogRecord()" and then "urllib.parse.urlencode()" to encode
     the dictionary in a form suitable for sending to a web server.


QueueHandler
============

New in version 3.2.

The "QueueHandler" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
supports sending logging messages to a queue, such as those
implemented in the "queue" or "multiprocessing" modules.

Along with the "QueueListener" class, "QueueHandler" can be used to
let handlers do their work on a separate thread from the one which
does the logging. This is important in web applications and also other
service applications where threads servicing clients need to respond
as quickly as possible, while any potentially slow operations (such as
sending an email via "SMTPHandler") are done on a separate thread.

                                  *QueueHandler..logging.handlers.txt*
class logging.handlers.QueueHandler(queue)

   Returns a new instance of the "QueueHandler" class. The instance is
   initialized with the queue to send messages to. The _queue_ can be
   any queue-like object; it’s used as-is by the "enqueue()" method,
   which needs to know how to send messages to it. The queue is not
   _required_ to have the task tracking API, which means that you can
   use "SimpleQueue" instances for _queue_.

   Note:

     If you are using "multiprocessing", you should avoid using
     "SimpleQueue" and instead use "multiprocessing.Queue".

   emit(record)               *QueueHandler.emit()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Enqueues the result of preparing the LogRecord. Should an
      exception occur (e.g. because a bounded queue has filled up),
      the "handleError()" method is called to handle the error. This
      can result in the record silently being dropped (if
      "logging.raiseExceptions" is "False") or a message printed to
      "sys.stderr" (if "logging.raiseExceptions" is "True").

   prepare(record)         *QueueHandler.prepare()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Prepares a record for queuing. The object returned by this
      method is enqueued.

      The base implementation formats the record to merge the message,
      arguments, exception and stack information, if present.  It also
      removes unpickleable items from the record in-place.
      Specifically, it overwrites the record’s "msg" and "message"
      attributes with the merged message (obtained by calling the
      handler’s "format()" method), and sets the "args", "exc_info"
      and "exc_text" attributes to "None".

      You might want to override this method if you want to convert
      the record to a dict or JSON string, or send a modified copy of
      the record while leaving the original intact.

      Note:

        The base implementation formats the message with arguments,
        sets the "message" and "msg" attributes to the formatted
        message and sets the "args" and "exc_text" attributes to
        "None" to allow pickling and to prevent further attempts at
        formatting. This means that a handler on the "QueueListener"
        side won’t have the information to do custom formatting, e.g.
        of exceptions. You may wish to subclass "QueueHandler" and
        override this method to e.g. avoid setting "exc_text" to
        "None". Note that the "message" / "msg" / "args" changes are
        related to ensuring the record is pickleable, and you might or
        might not be able to avoid doing that depending on whether
        your "args" are pickleable. (Note that you may have to
        consider not only your own code but also code in any libraries
        that you use.)

   enqueue(record)         *QueueHandler.enqueue()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Enqueues the record on the queue using "put_nowait()"; you may
      want to override this if you want to use blocking behaviour, or
      a timeout, or a customized queue implementation.

   listener                 *QueueHandler.listener..logging.handlers.txt*

      When created via configuration using "dictConfig()", this
      attribute will contain a "QueueListener" instance for use with
      this handler. Otherwise, it will be "None".

      New in version 3.12.


QueueListener
=============

New in version 3.2.

The "QueueListener" class, located in the "logging.handlers" module,
supports receiving logging messages from a queue, such as those
implemented in the "queue" or "multiprocessing" modules. The messages
are received from a queue in an internal thread and passed, on the
same thread, to one or more handlers for processing. While
"QueueListener" is not itself a handler, it is documented here because
it works hand-in-hand with "QueueHandler".

Along with the "QueueHandler" class, "QueueListener" can be used to
let handlers do their work on a separate thread from the one which
does the logging. This is important in web applications and also other
service applications where threads servicing clients need to respond
as quickly as possible, while any potentially slow operations (such as
sending an email via "SMTPHandler") are done on a separate thread.

class logging.handlers.QueueListener(queue, *handlers, respect_handler_level=False)

   Returns a new instance of the "QueueListener" class. The instance
   is initialized with the queue to send messages to and a list of
   handlers which will handle entries placed on the queue. The queue
   can be any queue-like object; it’s passed as-is to the "dequeue()"
   method, which needs to know how to get messages from it. The queue
   is not _required_ to have the task tracking API (though it’s used
   if available), which means that you can use "SimpleQueue" instances
   for _queue_.

   Note:

     If you are using "multiprocessing", you should avoid using
     "SimpleQueue" and instead use "multiprocessing.Queue".

   If "respect_handler_level" is "True", a handler’s level is
   respected (compared with the level for the message) when deciding
   whether to pass messages to that handler; otherwise, the behaviour
   is as in previous Python versions - to always pass each message to
   each handler.

   Changed in version 3.5: The "respect_handler_level" argument was
   added.

   dequeue(block)         *QueueListener.dequeue()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Dequeues a record and return it, optionally blocking.

      The base implementation uses "get()". You may want to override
      this method if you want to use timeouts or work with custom
      queue implementations.

   prepare(record)        *QueueListener.prepare()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Prepare a record for handling.

      This implementation just returns the passed-in record. You may
      want to override this method if you need to do any custom
      marshalling or manipulation of the record before passing it to
      the handlers.

   handle(record)          *QueueListener.handle()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Handle a record.

      This just loops through the handlers offering them the record to
      handle. The actual object passed to the handlers is that which
      is returned from "prepare()".

   start()                  *QueueListener.start()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Starts the listener.

      This starts up a background thread to monitor the queue for
      LogRecords to process.

   stop()                    *QueueListener.stop()..logging.handlers.txt*

      Stops the listener.

      This asks the thread to terminate, and then waits for it to do
      so. Note that if you don’t call this before your application
      exits, there may be some records still left on the queue, which
      won’t be processed.

              *QueueListener.enqueue_sentinel()..logging.handlers.txt*
   enqueue_sentinel()

      Writes a sentinel to the queue to tell the listener to quit.
      This implementation uses "put_nowait()".  You may want to
      override this method if you want to use timeouts or work with
      custom queue implementations.

      New in version 3.3.
