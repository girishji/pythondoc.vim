"logging" — Logging facility for Python
***************************************

**Source code:** Lib/logging/__init__.py


Important
^^^^^^^^^

This page contains the API reference information. For tutorial
information and discussion of more advanced topics, see

* Basic Tutorial

* Advanced Tutorial

* Logging Cookbook

======================================================================

This module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible
event logging system for applications and libraries.

The key benefit of having the logging API provided by a standard
library module is that all Python modules can participate in logging,
so your application log can include your own messages integrated with
messages from third-party modules.

The simplest example:
>
   >>> import logging
   >>> logging.warning('Watch out!')
   WARNING:root:Watch out!
<
The module provides a lot of functionality and flexibility.  If you
are unfamiliar with logging, the best way to get to grips with it is
to view the tutorials (**see the links above and on the right**).

The basic classes defined by the module, together with their
functions, are listed below.

* Loggers expose the interface that application code directly uses.

* Handlers send the log records (created by loggers) to the
  appropriate destination.

* Filters provide a finer grained facility for determining which log
  records to output.

* Formatters specify the layout of log records in the final output.


Logger Objects
==============

Loggers have the following attributes and methods.  Note that Loggers
should _NEVER_ be instantiated directly, but always through the
module-level function "logging.getLogger(name)".  Multiple calls to
"getLogger()" with the same name will always return a reference to the
same Logger object.

The "name" is potentially a period-separated hierarchical value, like
"foo.bar.baz" (though it could also be just plain "foo", for example).
Loggers that are further down in the hierarchical list are children of
loggers higher up in the list.  For example, given a logger with a
name of "foo", loggers with names of "foo.bar", "foo.bar.baz", and
"foo.bam" are all descendants of "foo".  The logger name hierarchy is
analogous to the Python package hierarchy, and identical to it if you
organise your loggers on a per-module basis using the recommended
construction "logging.getLogger(__name__)".  That’s because in a
module, "__name__" is the module’s name in the Python package
namespace.

class logging.Logger                             *Logger..logging.txt*

   propagate                              *Logger.propagate..logging.txt*

      If this attribute evaluates to true, events logged to this
      logger will be passed to the handlers of higher level (ancestor)
      loggers, in addition to any handlers attached to this logger.
      Messages are passed directly to the ancestor loggers’ handlers -
      neither the level nor filters of the ancestor loggers in
      question are considered.

      If this evaluates to false, logging messages are not passed to
      the handlers of ancestor loggers.

      Spelling it out with an example: If the propagate attribute of
      the logger named "A.B.C" evaluates to true, any event logged to
      "A.B.C" via a method call such as
      "logging.getLogger('A.B.C').error(...)" will [subject to passing
      that logger’s level and filter settings] be passed in turn to
      any handlers attached to loggers named "A.B", "A" and the root
      logger, after first being passed to any handlers attached to
      "A.B.C". If any logger in the chain "A.B.C", "A.B", "A" has its
      "propagate" attribute set to false, then that is the last logger
      whose handlers are offered the event to handle, and propagation
      stops at that point.

      The constructor sets this attribute to "True".

      Note:

        If you attach a handler to a logger _and_ one or more of its
        ancestors, it may emit the same record multiple times. In
        general, you should not need to attach a handler to more than
        one logger - if you just attach it to the appropriate logger
        which is highest in the logger hierarchy, then it will see all
        events logged by all descendant loggers, provided that their
        propagate setting is left set to "True". A common scenario is
        to attach handlers only to the root logger, and to let
        propagation take care of the rest.

   setLevel(level)                       *Logger.setLevel()..logging.txt*

      Sets the threshold for this logger to _level_. Logging messages
      which are less severe than _level_ will be ignored; logging
      messages which have severity _level_ or higher will be emitted
      by whichever handler or handlers service this logger, unless a
      handler’s level has been set to a higher severity level than
      _level_.

      When a logger is created, the level is set to "NOTSET" (which
      causes all messages to be processed when the logger is the root
      logger, or delegation to the parent when the logger is a non-
      root logger). Note that the root logger is created with level
      "WARNING".

      The term ‘delegation to the parent’ means that if a logger has a
      level of NOTSET, its chain of ancestor loggers is traversed
      until either an ancestor with a level other than NOTSET is
      found, or the root is reached.

      If an ancestor is found with a level other than NOTSET, then
      that ancestor’s level is treated as the effective level of the
      logger where the ancestor search began, and is used to determine
      how a logging event is handled.

      If the root is reached, and it has a level of NOTSET, then all
      messages will be processed. Otherwise, the root’s level will be
      used as the effective level.

      See Logging Levels for a list of levels.

      Changed in version 3.2: The _level_ parameter now accepts a
      string representation of the level such as ‘INFO’ as an
      alternative to the integer constants such as "INFO". Note,
      however, that levels are internally stored as integers, and
      methods such as e.g. "getEffectiveLevel()" and "isEnabledFor()"
      will return/expect to be passed integers.

   isEnabledFor(level)               *Logger.isEnabledFor()..logging.txt*

      Indicates if a message of severity _level_ would be processed by
      this logger. This method checks first the module-level level set
      by "logging.disable(level)" and then the logger’s effective
      level as determined by "getEffectiveLevel()".

   getEffectiveLevel()          *Logger.getEffectiveLevel()..logging.txt*

      Indicates the effective level for this logger. If a value other
      than "NOTSET" has been set using "setLevel()", it is returned.
      Otherwise, the hierarchy is traversed towards the root until a
      value other than "NOTSET" is found, and that value is returned.
      The value returned is an integer, typically one of
      "logging.DEBUG", "logging.INFO" etc.

   getChild(suffix)                      *Logger.getChild()..logging.txt*

      Returns a logger which is a descendant to this logger, as
      determined by the suffix. Thus,
      "logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi')" would return the
      same logger as would be returned by
      "logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')". This is a convenience
      method, useful when the parent logger is named using e.g.
      "__name__" rather than a literal string.

      New in version 3.2.

   getChildren()                      *Logger.getChildren()..logging.txt*

      Returns a set of loggers which are immediate children of this
      logger. So for example "logging.getLogger().getChildren()" might
      return a set containing loggers named "foo" and "bar", but a
      logger named "foo.bar" wouldn’t be included in the set.
      Likewise, "logging.getLogger('foo').getChildren()" might return
      a set including a logger named "foo.bar", but it wouldn’t
      include one named "foo.bar.baz".

      New in version 3.12.

   debug(msg, *args, **kwargs)              *Logger.debug()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with level "DEBUG" on this logger. The _msg_ is
      the message format string, and the _args_ are the arguments
      which are merged into _msg_ using the string formatting
      operator. (Note that this means that you can use keywords in the
      format string, together with a single dictionary argument.) No %
      formatting operation is performed on _msg_ when no _args_ are
      supplied.

      There are four keyword arguments in _kwargs_ which are
      inspected: _exc_info_, _stack_info_, _stacklevel_ and _extra_.

      If _exc_info_ does not evaluate as false, it causes exception
      information to be added to the logging message. If an exception
      tuple (in the format returned by "sys.exc_info()") or an
      exception instance is provided, it is used; otherwise,
      "sys.exc_info()" is called to get the exception information.

      The second optional keyword argument is _stack_info_, which
      defaults to "False". If true, stack information is added to the
      logging message, including the actual logging call. Note that
      this is not the same stack information as that displayed through
      specifying _exc_info_: The former is stack frames from the
      bottom of the stack up to the logging call in the current
      thread, whereas the latter is information about stack frames
      which have been unwound, following an exception, while searching
      for exception handlers.

      You can specify _stack_info_ independently of _exc_info_, e.g.
      to just show how you got to a certain point in your code, even
      when no exceptions were raised. The stack frames are printed
      following a header line which says:
>
         Stack (most recent call last):
<
      This mimics the "Traceback (most recent call last):" which is
      used when displaying exception frames.

      The third optional keyword argument is _stacklevel_, which
      defaults to "1". If greater than 1, the corresponding number of
      stack frames are skipped when computing the line number and
      function name set in the "LogRecord" created for the logging
      event. This can be used in logging helpers so that the function
      name, filename and line number recorded are not the information
      for the helper function/method, but rather its caller. The name
      of this parameter mirrors the equivalent one in the "warnings"
      module.

      The fourth keyword argument is _extra_ which can be used to pass
      a dictionary which is used to populate the __dict__ of the
      "LogRecord" created for the logging event with user-defined
      attributes. These custom attributes can then be used as you
      like. For example, they could be incorporated into logged
      messages. For example:
>
         FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(clientip)-15s %(user)-8s %(message)s'
         logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)
         d = {'clientip': '192.168.0.1', 'user': 'fbloggs'}
         logger = logging.getLogger('tcpserver')
         logger.warning('Protocol problem: %s', 'connection reset', extra=d)
<
      would print something like
>
         2006-02-08 22:20:02,165 192.168.0.1 fbloggs  Protocol problem: connection reset
<
      The keys in the dictionary passed in _extra_ should not clash
      with the keys used by the logging system. (See the section on
      LogRecord attributes for more information on which keys are used
      by the logging system.)

      If you choose to use these attributes in logged messages, you
      need to exercise some care. In the above example, for instance,
      the "Formatter" has been set up with a format string which
      expects ‘clientip’ and ‘user’ in the attribute dictionary of the
      "LogRecord". If these are missing, the message will not be
      logged because a string formatting exception will occur. So in
      this case, you always need to pass the _extra_ dictionary with
      these keys.

      While this might be annoying, this feature is intended for use
      in specialized circumstances, such as multi-threaded servers
      where the same code executes in many contexts, and interesting
      conditions which arise are dependent on this context (such as
      remote client IP address and authenticated user name, in the
      above example). In such circumstances, it is likely that
      specialized "Formatter"s would be used with particular
      "Handler"s.

      If no handler is attached to this logger (or any of its
      ancestors, taking into account the relevant "Logger.propagate"
      attributes), the message will be sent to the handler set on
      "lastResort".

      Changed in version 3.2: The _stack_info_ parameter was added.

      Changed in version 3.5: The _exc_info_ parameter can now accept
      exception instances.

      Changed in version 3.8: The _stacklevel_ parameter was added.

      Changed in version 3.13: Remove the undocumented "warn()" method
      which was an alias to the "warning()" method.

   info(msg, *args, **kwargs)                *Logger.info()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with level "INFO" on this logger. The arguments
      are interpreted as for "debug()".

   warning(msg, *args, **kwargs)          *Logger.warning()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with level "WARNING" on this logger. The
      arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".

   error(msg, *args, **kwargs)              *Logger.error()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with level "ERROR" on this logger. The arguments
      are interpreted as for "debug()".

   critical(msg, *args, **kwargs)        *Logger.critical()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with level "CRITICAL" on this logger. The
      arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".

   log(level, msg, *args, **kwargs)           *Logger.log()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with integer level _level_ on this logger. The
      other arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".

   exception(msg, *args, **kwargs)      *Logger.exception()..logging.txt*

      Logs a message with level "ERROR" on this logger. The arguments
      are interpreted as for "debug()". Exception info is added to the
      logging message. This method should only be called from an
      exception handler.

   addFilter(filter)                    *Logger.addFilter()..logging.txt*

      Adds the specified filter _filter_ to this logger.

   removeFilter(filter)              *Logger.removeFilter()..logging.txt*

      Removes the specified filter _filter_ from this logger.

   filter(record)                          *Logger.filter()..logging.txt*

      Apply this logger’s filters to the record and return "True" if
      the record is to be processed. The filters are consulted in
      turn, until one of them returns a false value. If none of them
      return a false value, the record will be processed (passed to
      handlers). If one returns a false value, no further processing
      of the record occurs.

   addHandler(hdlr)                    *Logger.addHandler()..logging.txt*

      Adds the specified handler _hdlr_ to this logger.

   removeHandler(hdlr)              *Logger.removeHandler()..logging.txt*

      Removes the specified handler _hdlr_ from this logger.

                                    *Logger.findCaller()..logging.txt*
   findCaller(stack_info=False, stacklevel=1)

      Finds the caller’s source filename and line number. Returns the
      filename, line number, function name and stack information as a
      4-element tuple. The stack information is returned as "None"
      unless _stack_info_ is "True".

      The _stacklevel_ parameter is passed from code calling the
      "debug()" and other APIs. If greater than 1, the excess is used
      to skip stack frames before determining the values to be
      returned. This will generally be useful when calling logging
      APIs from helper/wrapper code, so that the information in the
      event log refers not to the helper/wrapper code, but to the code
      that calls it.

   handle(record)                          *Logger.handle()..logging.txt*

      Handles a record by passing it to all handlers associated with
      this logger and its ancestors (until a false value of
      _propagate_ is found). This method is used for unpickled records
      received from a socket, as well as those created locally.
      Logger-level filtering is applied using "filter()".

                                    *Logger.makeRecord()..logging.txt*
   makeRecord(name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, extra=None, sinfo=None)

      This is a factory method which can be overridden in subclasses
      to create specialized "LogRecord" instances.

   hasHandlers()                      *Logger.hasHandlers()..logging.txt*

      Checks to see if this logger has any handlers configured. This
      is done by looking for handlers in this logger and its parents
      in the logger hierarchy. Returns "True" if a handler was found,
      else "False". The method stops searching up the hierarchy
      whenever a logger with the ‘propagate’ attribute set to false is
      found - that will be the last logger which is checked for the
      existence of handlers.

      New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.7: Loggers can now be pickled and unpickled.


Logging Levels
==============

The numeric values of logging levels are given in the following table.
These are primarily of interest if you want to define your own levels,
and need them to have specific values relative to the predefined
levels. If you define a level with the same numeric value, it
overwrites the predefined value; the predefined name is lost.

+-------------------------+-----------------+---------------------------------------+
| Level                   | Numeric value   | What it means / When to use it        |
|=========================|=================|=======================================|
| logging.NOTSET          | 0               | When set on a logger, indicates that  |
|                         |                 | ancestor loggers are to be consulted  |
|                         |                 | to determine the effective level. If  |
|                         |                 | that still resolves to "NOTSET", then |
|                         |                 | all events are logged. When set on a  |
|                         |                 | handler, all events are handled.      |

|                         |                 | continue running.                     |
+-------------------------+-----------------+---------------------------------------+


Handler Objects
===============

Handlers have the following attributes and methods. Note that
"Handler" is never instantiated directly; this class acts as a base
for more useful subclasses. However, the "__init__()" method in
subclasses needs to call "Handler.__init__()".

class logging.Handler                           *Handler..logging.txt*

   __init__(level=NOTSET)               *Handler.__init__()..logging.txt*

      Initializes the "Handler" instance by setting its level, setting
      the list of filters to the empty list and creating a lock (using
      "createLock()") for serializing access to an I/O mechanism.

   createLock()                       *Handler.createLock()..logging.txt*

      Initializes a thread lock which can be used to serialize access
      to underlying I/O functionality which may not be threadsafe.

   acquire()                             *Handler.acquire()..logging.txt*

      Acquires the thread lock created with "createLock()".

   release()                             *Handler.release()..logging.txt*

      Releases the thread lock acquired with "acquire()".

   setLevel(level)                      *Handler.setLevel()..logging.txt*

      Sets the threshold for this handler to _level_. Logging messages
      which are less severe than _level_ will be ignored. When a
      handler is created, the level is set to "NOTSET" (which causes
      all messages to be processed).

      See Logging Levels for a list of levels.

      Changed in version 3.2: The _level_ parameter now accepts a
      string representation of the level such as ‘INFO’ as an
      alternative to the integer constants such as "INFO".

   setFormatter(fmt)                *Handler.setFormatter()..logging.txt*

      Sets the "Formatter" for this handler to _fmt_.

   addFilter(filter)                   *Handler.addFilter()..logging.txt*

      Adds the specified filter _filter_ to this handler.

   removeFilter(filter)             *Handler.removeFilter()..logging.txt*

      Removes the specified filter _filter_ from this handler.

   filter(record)                         *Handler.filter()..logging.txt*

      Apply this handler’s filters to the record and return "True" if
      the record is to be processed. The filters are consulted in
      turn, until one of them returns a false value. If none of them
      return a false value, the record will be emitted. If one returns
      a false value, the handler will not emit the record.

   flush()                                 *Handler.flush()..logging.txt*

      Ensure all logging output has been flushed. This version does
      nothing and is intended to be implemented by subclasses.

   close()                                 *Handler.close()..logging.txt*

      Tidy up any resources used by the handler. This version does no
      output but removes the handler from an internal list of handlers
      which is closed when "shutdown()" is called. Subclasses should
      ensure that this gets called from overridden "close()" methods.

   handle(record)                         *Handler.handle()..logging.txt*

      Conditionally emits the specified logging record, depending on
      filters which may have been added to the handler. Wraps the
      actual emission of the record with acquisition/release of the
      I/O thread lock.

   handleError(record)               *Handler.handleError()..logging.txt*

      This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
      encountered during an "emit()" call. If the module-level
      attribute "raiseExceptions" is "False", exceptions get silently
      ignored. This is what is mostly wanted for a logging system -
      most users will not care about errors in the logging system,
      they are more interested in application errors. You could,
      however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish. The
      specified record is the one which was being processed when the
      exception occurred. (The default value of "raiseExceptions" is
      "True", as that is more useful during development).

   format(record)                         *Handler.format()..logging.txt*

      Do formatting for a record - if a formatter is set, use it.
      Otherwise, use the default formatter for the module.

   emit(record)                             *Handler.emit()..logging.txt*

      Do whatever it takes to actually log the specified logging
      record. This version is intended to be implemented by subclasses
      and so raises a "NotImplementedError".

      Warning:

        This method is called after a handler-level lock is acquired,
        which is released after this method returns. When you override
        this method, note that you should be careful when calling
        anything that invokes other parts of the logging API which
        might do locking, because that might result in a deadlock.
        Specifically:

        * Logging configuration APIs acquire the module-level lock,
          and then individual handler-level locks as those handlers
          are configured.

        * Many logging APIs lock the module-level lock. If such an API
          is called from this method, it could cause a deadlock if a
          configuration call is made on another thread, because that
          thread will try to acquire the module-level lock _before_
          the handler-level lock, whereas this thread tries to acquire
          the module-level lock _after_ the handler-level lock
          (because in this method, the handler-level lock has already
          been acquired).

For a list of handlers included as standard, see "logging.handlers".


Formatter Objects
=================

                                              *Formatter..logging.txt*
class logging.Formatter(fmt=None, datefmt=None, style='%', validate=True, *, defaults=None)

   Responsible for converting a "LogRecord" to an output string to be
   interpreted by a human or external system.

   Parameters:
      * **fmt** (_str_) – A format string in the given _style_ for the
        logged output as a whole. The possible mapping keys are drawn
        from the "LogRecord" object’s LogRecord attributes. If not
        specified, "'%(message)s'" is used, which is just the logged
        message.

      * **datefmt** (_str_) – A format string in the given _style_ for
        the date/time portion of the logged output. If not specified,
        the default described in "formatTime()" is used.

      * **style** (_str_) – Can be one of "'%'", "'{'" or "'$'" and
        determines how the format string will be merged with its data:
        using one of printf-style String Formatting ("%"),
        "str.format()" ("{") or "string.Template" ("$"). This only
        applies to _fmt_ and _datefmt_ (e.g. "'%(message)s'" versus
        "'{message}'"), not to the actual log messages passed to the
        logging methods. However, there are other ways to use "{"- and
        "$"-formatting for log messages.

      * **validate** (_bool_) – If "True" (the default), incorrect or
        mismatched _fmt_ and _style_ will raise a "ValueError"; for
        example, "logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(message)s',
        style='{')".

      * **defaults** (_dict__[__str__, __Any__]_) – A dictionary with
        default values to use in custom fields. For example,
        "logging.Formatter('%(ip)s %(message)s', defaults={"ip":
        None})"

   New in version 3.2: The _style_ parameter.

   New in version 3.8: The _validate_ parameter.

   New in version 3.10: The _defaults_ parameter.

   format(record)                       *Formatter.format()..logging.txt*

      The record’s attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a
      string formatting operation. Returns the resulting string.
      Before formatting the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps
      are carried out. The _message_ attribute of the record is
      computed using _msg_ % _args_. If the formatting string contains
      "'(asctime)'", "formatTime()" is called to format the event
      time. If there is exception information, it is formatted using
      "formatException()" and appended to the message. Note that the
      formatted exception information is cached in attribute
      _exc_text_. This is useful because the exception information can
      be pickled and sent across the wire, but you should be careful
      if you have more than one "Formatter" subclass which customizes
      the formatting of exception information. In this case, you will
      have to clear the cached value (by setting the _exc_text_
      attribute to "None") after a formatter has done its formatting,
      so that the next formatter to handle the event doesn’t use the
      cached value, but recalculates it afresh.

      If stack information is available, it’s appended after the
      exception information, using "formatStack()" to transform it if
      necessary.

                                 *Formatter.formatTime()..logging.txt*
   formatTime(record, datefmt=None)

      This method should be called from "format()" by a formatter
      which wants to make use of a formatted time. This method can be
      overridden in formatters to provide for any specific
      requirement, but the basic behavior is as follows: if _datefmt_
      (a string) is specified, it is used with "time.strftime()" to
      format the creation time of the record. Otherwise, the format
      ‘%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,uuu’ is used, where the uuu part is a
      millisecond value and the other letters are as per the
      "time.strftime()" documentation.  An example time in this format
      is "2003-01-23 00:29:50,411".  The resulting string is returned.

      This function uses a user-configurable function to convert the
      creation time to a tuple. By default, "time.localtime()" is
      used; to change this for a particular formatter instance, set
      the "converter" attribute to a function with the same signature
      as "time.localtime()" or "time.gmtime()". To change it for all
      formatters, for example if you want all logging times to be
      shown in GMT, set the "converter" attribute in the "Formatter"
      class.

      Changed in version 3.3: Previously, the default format was hard-
      coded as in this example: "2010-09-06 22:38:15,292" where the
      part before the comma is handled by a strptime format string
      ("'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'"), and the part after the comma is a
      millisecond value. Because strptime does not have a format
      placeholder for milliseconds, the millisecond value is appended
      using another format string, "'%s,%03d'" — and both of these
      format strings have been hardcoded into this method. With the
      change, these strings are defined as class-level attributes
      which can be overridden at the instance level when desired. The
      names of the attributes are "default_time_format" (for the
      strptime format string) and "default_msec_format" (for appending
      the millisecond value).

      Changed in version 3.9: The "default_msec_format" can be "None".

   formatException(exc_info)   *Formatter.formatException()..logging.txt*

      Formats the specified exception information (a standard
      exception tuple as returned by "sys.exc_info()") as a string.
      This default implementation just uses
      "traceback.print_exception()". The resulting string is returned.

   formatStack(stack_info)         *Formatter.formatStack()..logging.txt*

      Formats the specified stack information (a string as returned by
      "traceback.print_stack()", but with the last newline removed) as
      a string. This default implementation just returns the input
      value.

                                     *BufferingFormatter..logging.txt*
class logging.BufferingFormatter(linefmt=None)

   A base formatter class suitable for subclassing when you want to
   format a number of records. You can pass a "Formatter" instance
   which you want to use to format each line (that corresponds to a
   single record). If not specified, the default formatter (which just
   outputs the event message) is used as the line formatter.

                      *BufferingFormatter.formatHeader()..logging.txt*
   formatHeader(records)

      Return a header for a list of _records_. The base implementation
      just returns the empty string. You will need to override this
      method if you want specific behaviour, e.g. to show the count of
      records, a title or a separator line.

                      *BufferingFormatter.formatFooter()..logging.txt*
   formatFooter(records)

      Return a footer for a list of _records_. The base implementation
      just returns the empty string. You will need to override this
      method if you want specific behaviour, e.g. to show the count of
      records or a separator line.

   format(records)             *BufferingFormatter.format()..logging.txt*

      Return formatted text for a list of _records_. The base
      implementation just returns the empty string if there are no
      records; otherwise, it returns the concatenation of the header,
      each record formatted with the line formatter, and the footer.


Filter Objects
==============

"Filters" can be used by "Handlers" and "Loggers" for more
sophisticated filtering than is provided by levels. The base filter
class only allows events which are below a certain point in the logger
hierarchy. For example, a filter initialized with ‘A.B’ will allow
events logged by loggers ‘A.B’, ‘A.B.C’, ‘A.B.C.D’, ‘A.B.D’ etc. but
not ‘A.BB’, ‘B.A.B’ etc. If initialized with the empty string, all
events are passed.

class logging.Filter(name='')                    *Filter..logging.txt*

   Returns an instance of the "Filter" class. If _name_ is specified,
   it names a logger which, together with its children, will have its
   events allowed through the filter. If _name_ is the empty string,
   allows every event.

   filter(record)                          *Filter.filter()..logging.txt*

      Is the specified record to be logged? Returns false for no, true
      for yes. Filters can either modify log records in-place or
      return a completely different record instance which will replace
      the original log record in any future processing of the event.

Note that filters attached to handlers are consulted before an event
is emitted by the handler, whereas filters attached to loggers are
consulted whenever an event is logged (using "debug()", "info()",
etc.), before sending an event to handlers. This means that events
which have been generated by descendant loggers will not be filtered
by a logger’s filter setting, unless the filter has also been applied
to those descendant loggers.

You don’t actually need to subclass "Filter": you can pass any
instance which has a "filter" method with the same semantics.

Changed in version 3.2: You don’t need to create specialized "Filter"
classes, or use other classes with a "filter" method: you can use a
function (or other callable) as a filter. The filtering logic will
check to see if the filter object has a "filter" attribute: if it
does, it’s assumed to be a "Filter" and its "filter()" method is
called. Otherwise, it’s assumed to be a callable and called with the
record as the single parameter. The returned value should conform to
that returned by "filter()".

Changed in version 3.12: You can now return a "LogRecord" instance
from filters to replace the log record rather than modifying it in
place. This allows filters attached to a "Handler" to modify the log
record before it is emitted, without having side effects on other
handlers.

Although filters are used primarily to filter records based on more
sophisticated criteria than levels, they get to see every record which
is processed by the handler or logger they’re attached to: this can be
useful if you want to do things like counting how many records were
processed by a particular logger or handler, or adding, changing or
removing attributes in the "LogRecord" being processed. Obviously
changing the LogRecord needs to be done with some care, but it does
allow the injection of contextual information into logs (see Using
Filters to impart contextual information).


LogRecord Objects
=================

"LogRecord" instances are created automatically by the "Logger" every
time something is logged, and can be created manually via
"makeLogRecord()" (for example, from a pickled event received over the
wire).

                                              *LogRecord..logging.txt*
class logging.LogRecord(name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, sinfo=None)

   Contains all the information pertinent to the event being logged.

   The primary information is passed in _msg_ and _args_, which are
   combined using "msg % args" to create the "message" attribute of
   the record.

   Parameters:
      * **name** (_str_) – The name of the logger used to log the
        event represented by this "LogRecord". Note that the logger
        name in the "LogRecord" will always have this value, even
        though it may be emitted by a handler attached to a different
        (ancestor) logger.

      * **level** (_int_) – The numeric level of the logging event
        (such as "10" for "DEBUG", "20" for "INFO", etc). Note that
        this is converted to _two_ attributes of the LogRecord:
        "levelno" for the numeric value and "levelname" for the
        corresponding level name.

      * **pathname** (_str_) – The full string path of the source file
        where the logging call was made.

      * **lineno** (_int_) – The line number in the source file where
        the logging call was made.

      * **msg** (_Any_) – The event description message, which can be
        a %-format string with placeholders for variable data, or an
        arbitrary object (see Using arbitrary objects as messages).

      * **args** (_tuple__ | __dict__[__str__, __Any__]_) – Variable
        data to merge into the _msg_ argument to obtain the event
        description.

      * **exc_info** (_tuple__[__type__[__BaseException__]__,
        __BaseException__, __types.TracebackType__] __| __None_) – An
        exception tuple with the current exception information, as
        returned by "sys.exc_info()", or "None" if no exception
        information is available.

      * **func** (_str__ | __None_) – The name of the function or
        method from which the logging call was invoked.

      * **sinfo** (_str__ | __None_) – A text string representing
        stack information from the base of the stack in the current
        thread, up to the logging call.

   getMessage()                     *LogRecord.getMessage()..logging.txt*

      Returns the message for this "LogRecord" instance after merging
      any user-supplied arguments with the message. If the user-
      supplied message argument to the logging call is not a string,
      "str()" is called on it to convert it to a string. This allows
      use of user-defined classes as messages, whose "__str__" method
      can return the actual format string to be used.

   Changed in version 3.2: The creation of a "LogRecord" has been made
   more configurable by providing a factory which is used to create
   the record. The factory can be set using "getLogRecordFactory()"
   and "setLogRecordFactory()" (see this for the factory’s signature).

   This functionality can be used to inject your own values into a
   "LogRecord" at creation time. You can use the following pattern:
>
      old_factory = logging.getLogRecordFactory()

      def record_factory(*args, **kwargs):
          record = old_factory(*args, **kwargs)
          record.custom_attribute = 0xdecafbad
          return record

      logging.setLogRecordFactory(record_factory)
<
   With this pattern, multiple factories could be chained, and as long
   as they don’t overwrite each other’s attributes or unintentionally
   overwrite the standard attributes listed above, there should be no
   surprises.


LogRecord attributes
====================

The LogRecord has a number of attributes, most of which are derived
from the parameters to the constructor. (Note that the names do not
always correspond exactly between the LogRecord constructor parameters
and the LogRecord attributes.) These attributes can be used to merge
data from the record into the format string. The following table lists
(in alphabetical order) the attribute names, their meanings and the
corresponding placeholder in a %-style format string.

If you are using {}-formatting ("str.format()"), you can use
"{attrname}" as the placeholder in the format string. If you are using
$-formatting ("string.Template"), use the form "${attrname}". In both
cases, of course, replace "attrname" with the actual attribute name
you want to use.

In the case of {}-formatting, you can specify formatting flags by
placing them after the attribute name, separated from it with a colon.
For example: a placeholder of "{msecs:03d}" would format a millisecond
value of "4" as "004". Refer to the "str.format()" documentation for
full details on the options available to you.

Changed in version 3.1: _processName_ was added.

Changed in version 3.12: _taskName_ was added.


LoggerAdapter Objects
=====================

"LoggerAdapter" instances are used to conveniently pass contextual
information into logging calls. For a usage example, see the section
on adding contextual information to your logging output.

                                          *LoggerAdapter..logging.txt*
class logging.LoggerAdapter(logger, extra, merge_extra=False)

   Returns an instance of "LoggerAdapter" initialized with an
   underlying "Logger" instance, a dict-like object (_extra_), and a
   boolean (_merge_extra_) indicating whether or not the _extra_
   argument of individual log calls should be merged with the
   "LoggerAdapter" extra. The default behavior is to ignore the
   _extra_ argument of individual log calls and only use the one of
   the "LoggerAdapter" instance

   process(msg, kwargs)            *LoggerAdapter.process()..logging.txt*

      Modifies the message and/or keyword arguments passed to a
      logging call in order to insert contextual information. This
      implementation takes the object passed as _extra_ to the
      constructor and adds it to _kwargs_ using key ‘extra’. The
      return value is a (_msg_, _kwargs_) tuple which has the
      (possibly modified) versions of the arguments passed in.

   manager                           *LoggerAdapter.manager..logging.txt*

      Delegates to the underlying "manager`" on _logger_.

   _log                                 *LoggerAdapter._log..logging.txt*

      Delegates to the underlying "_log`()" method on _logger_.

   In addition to the above, "LoggerAdapter" supports the following
   methods of "Logger": "debug()", "info()", "warning()", "error()",
   "exception()", "critical()", "log()", "isEnabledFor()",
   "getEffectiveLevel()", "setLevel()" and "hasHandlers()". These
   methods have the same signatures as their counterparts in "Logger",
   so you can use the two types of instances interchangeably.

   Changed in version 3.2: The "isEnabledFor()",
   "getEffectiveLevel()", "setLevel()" and "hasHandlers()" methods
   were added to "LoggerAdapter".  These methods delegate to the
   underlying logger.

   Changed in version 3.6: Attribute "manager" and method "_log()"
   were added, which delegate to the underlying logger and allow
   adapters to be nested.

   Changed in version 3.13: Remove the undocumented "warn`()" method
   which was an alias to the "warning()" method.

   Changed in version 3.13: The _merge_extra_ argument was added.


Thread Safety
=============

The logging module is intended to be thread-safe without any special
work needing to be done by its clients. It achieves this though using
threading locks; there is one lock to serialize access to the module’s
shared data, and each handler also creates a lock to serialize access
to its underlying I/O.

If you are implementing asynchronous signal handlers using the
"signal" module, you may not be able to use logging from within such
handlers. This is because lock implementations in the "threading"
module are not always re-entrant, and so cannot be invoked from such
signal handlers.


Module-Level Functions
======================

In addition to the classes described above, there are a number of
module-level functions.

logging.getLogger(name=None)                *getLogger()..logging.txt*

   Return a logger with the specified name or, if name is "None",
   return a logger which is the root logger of the hierarchy. If
   specified, the name is typically a dot-separated hierarchical name
   like _‘a’_, _‘a.b’_ or _‘a.b.c.d’_. Choice of these names is
   entirely up to the developer who is using logging.

   All calls to this function with a given name return the same logger
   instance. This means that logger instances never need to be passed
   between different parts of an application.

logging.getLoggerClass()               *getLoggerClass()..logging.txt*

   Return either the standard "Logger" class, or the last class passed
   to "setLoggerClass()". This function may be called from within a
   new class definition, to ensure that installing a customized
   "Logger" class will not undo customizations already applied by
   other code. For example:
>
      class MyLogger(logging.getLoggerClass()):
          # ... override behaviour here
<
logging.getLogRecordFactory()     *getLogRecordFactory()..logging.txt*

   Return a callable which is used to create a "LogRecord".

   New in version 3.2: This function has been provided, along with
   "setLogRecordFactory()", to allow developers more control over how
   the "LogRecord" representing a logging event is constructed.

   See "setLogRecordFactory()" for more information about the how the
   factory is called.

logging.debug(msg, *args, **kwargs)             *debug()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level "DEBUG" on the root logger. The _msg_ is
   the message format string, and the _args_ are the arguments which
   are merged into _msg_ using the string formatting operator. (Note
   that this means that you can use keywords in the format string,
   together with a single dictionary argument.)

   There are three keyword arguments in _kwargs_ which are inspected:
   _exc_info_ which, if it does not evaluate as false, causes
   exception information to be added to the logging message. If an
   exception tuple (in the format returned by "sys.exc_info()") or an
   exception instance is provided, it is used; otherwise,
   "sys.exc_info()" is called to get the exception information.

   The second optional keyword argument is _stack_info_, which
   defaults to "False". If true, stack information is added to the
   logging message, including the actual logging call. Note that this
   is not the same stack information as that displayed through
   specifying _exc_info_: The former is stack frames from the bottom
   of the stack up to the logging call in the current thread, whereas
   the latter is information about stack frames which have been
   unwound, following an exception, while searching for exception
   handlers.

   You can specify _stack_info_ independently of _exc_info_, e.g. to
   just show how you got to a certain point in your code, even when no
   exceptions were raised. The stack frames are printed following a
   header line which says:
>
      Stack (most recent call last):
<
   This mimics the "Traceback (most recent call last):" which is used
   when displaying exception frames.

   The third optional keyword argument is _extra_ which can be used to
   pass a dictionary which is used to populate the __dict__ of the
   LogRecord created for the logging event with user-defined
   attributes. These custom attributes can then be used as you like.
   For example, they could be incorporated into logged messages. For
   example:
>
      FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(clientip)-15s %(user)-8s %(message)s'
      logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)
      d = {'clientip': '192.168.0.1', 'user': 'fbloggs'}
      logging.warning('Protocol problem: %s', 'connection reset', extra=d)
<
   would print something like:
>
      2006-02-08 22:20:02,165 192.168.0.1 fbloggs  Protocol problem: connection reset
<
   The keys in the dictionary passed in _extra_ should not clash with
   the keys used by the logging system. (See the "Formatter"
   documentation for more information on which keys are used by the
   logging system.)

   If you choose to use these attributes in logged messages, you need
   to exercise some care. In the above example, for instance, the
   "Formatter" has been set up with a format string which expects
   ‘clientip’ and ‘user’ in the attribute dictionary of the LogRecord.
   If these are missing, the message will not be logged because a
   string formatting exception will occur. So in this case, you always
   need to pass the _extra_ dictionary with these keys.

   While this might be annoying, this feature is intended for use in
   specialized circumstances, such as multi-threaded servers where the
   same code executes in many contexts, and interesting conditions
   which arise are dependent on this context (such as remote client IP
   address and authenticated user name, in the above example). In such
   circumstances, it is likely that specialized "Formatter"s would be
   used with particular "Handler"s.

   This function (as well as "info()", "warning()", "error()" and
   "critical()") will call "basicConfig()" if the root logger doesn’t
   have any handler attached.

   Changed in version 3.2: The _stack_info_ parameter was added.

logging.info(msg, *args, **kwargs)               *info()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level "INFO" on the root logger. The arguments
   are interpreted as for "debug()".

logging.warning(msg, *args, **kwargs)         *warning()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level "WARNING" on the root logger. The
   arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".

   Note:

     There is an obsolete function "warn" which is functionally
     identical to "warning". As "warn" is deprecated, please do not
     use it - use "warning" instead.

   Changed in version 3.13: Remove the undocumented "warn()" function
   which was an alias to the "warning()" function.

logging.error(msg, *args, **kwargs)             *error()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level "ERROR" on the root logger. The arguments
   are interpreted as for "debug()".

logging.critical(msg, *args, **kwargs)       *critical()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level "CRITICAL" on the root logger. The
   arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".

logging.exception(msg, *args, **kwargs)     *exception()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level "ERROR" on the root logger. The arguments
   are interpreted as for "debug()". Exception info is added to the
   logging message. This function should only be called from an
   exception handler.

logging.log(level, msg, *args, **kwargs)          *log()..logging.txt*

   Logs a message with level _level_ on the root logger. The other
   arguments are interpreted as for "debug()".

logging.disable(level=CRITICAL)               *disable()..logging.txt*

   Provides an overriding level _level_ for all loggers which takes
   precedence over the logger’s own level. When the need arises to
   temporarily throttle logging output down across the whole
   application, this function can be useful. Its effect is to disable
   all logging calls of severity _level_ and below, so that if you
   call it with a value of INFO, then all INFO and DEBUG events would
   be discarded, whereas those of severity WARNING and above would be
   processed according to the logger’s effective level. If
   "logging.disable(logging.NOTSET)" is called, it effectively removes
   this overriding level, so that logging output again depends on the
   effective levels of individual loggers.

   Note that if you have defined any custom logging level higher than
   "CRITICAL" (this is not recommended), you won’t be able to rely on
   the default value for the _level_ parameter, but will have to
   explicitly supply a suitable value.

   Changed in version 3.7: The _level_ parameter was defaulted to
   level "CRITICAL". See bpo-28524 for more information about this
   change.

logging.addLevelName(level, levelName)   *addLevelName()..logging.txt*

   Associates level _level_ with text _levelName_ in an internal
   dictionary, which is used to map numeric levels to a textual
   representation, for example when a "Formatter" formats a message.
   This function can also be used to define your own levels. The only
   constraints are that all levels used must be registered using this
   function, levels should be positive integers and they should
   increase in increasing order of severity.

   Note:

     If you are thinking of defining your own levels, please see the
     section on Custom Levels.

logging.getLevelNamesMapping()   *getLevelNamesMapping()..logging.txt*

   Returns a mapping from level names to their corresponding logging
   levels. For example, the string “CRITICAL” maps to "CRITICAL". The
   returned mapping is copied from an internal mapping on each call to
   this function.

   New in version 3.11.

logging.getLevelName(level)              *getLevelName()..logging.txt*

   Returns the textual or numeric representation of logging level
   _level_.

   If _level_ is one of the predefined levels "CRITICAL", "ERROR",
   "WARNING", "INFO" or "DEBUG" then you get the corresponding string.
   If you have associated levels with names using "addLevelName()"
   then the name you have associated with _level_ is returned. If a
   numeric value corresponding to one of the defined levels is passed
   in, the corresponding string representation is returned.

   The _level_ parameter also accepts a string representation of the
   level such as ‘INFO’. In such cases, this functions returns the
   corresponding numeric value of the level.

   If no matching numeric or string value is passed in, the string
   ‘Level %s’ % level is returned.

   Note:

     Levels are internally integers (as they need to be compared in
     the logging logic). This function is used to convert between an
     integer level and the level name displayed in the formatted log
     output by means of the "%(levelname)s" format specifier (see
     LogRecord attributes), and vice versa.

   Changed in version 3.4: In Python versions earlier than 3.4, this
   function could also be passed a text level, and would return the
   corresponding numeric value of the level. This undocumented
   behaviour was considered a mistake, and was removed in Python 3.4,
   but reinstated in 3.4.2 due to retain backward compatibility.

logging.getHandlerByName(name)       *getHandlerByName()..logging.txt*

   Returns a handler with the specified _name_, or "None" if there is
   no handler with that name.

   New in version 3.12.

logging.getHandlerNames()             *getHandlerNames()..logging.txt*

   Returns an immutable set of all known handler names.

   New in version 3.12.

logging.makeLogRecord(attrdict)         *makeLogRecord()..logging.txt*

   Creates and returns a new "LogRecord" instance whose attributes are
   defined by _attrdict_. This function is useful for taking a pickled
   "LogRecord" attribute dictionary, sent over a socket, and
   reconstituting it as a "LogRecord" instance at the receiving end.

logging.basicConfig(**kwargs)             *basicConfig()..logging.txt*

   Does basic configuration for the logging system by creating a
   "StreamHandler" with a default "Formatter" and adding it to the
   root logger. The functions "debug()", "info()", "warning()",
   "error()" and "critical()" will call "basicConfig()" automatically
   if no handlers are defined for the root logger.

   This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
   configured, unless the keyword argument _force_ is set to "True".

   Note:

     This function should be called from the main thread before other
     threads are started. In versions of Python prior to 2.7.1 and
     3.2, if this function is called from multiple threads, it is
     possible (in rare circumstances) that a handler will be added to
     the root logger more than once, leading to unexpected results
     such as messages being duplicated in the log.

   The following keyword arguments are supported.

   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Format         | Description                                   |
   |================|===============================================|
   | _filename_     | Specifies that a "FileHandler" be created,    |
   |                | using the specified filename, rather than a   |
   |                | "StreamHandler".                              |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _filemode_     | If _filename_ is specified, open the file in  |
   |                | this mode. Defaults to "'a'".                 |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _format_       | Use the specified format string for the       |
   |                | handler. Defaults to attributes "levelname",  |
   |                | "name" and "message" separated by colons.     |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _datefmt_      | Use the specified date/time format, as        |
   |                | accepted by "time.strftime()".                |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _style_        | If _format_ is specified, use this style for  |
   |                | the format string. One of "'%'", "'{'" or     |
   |                | "'$'" for printf-style, "str.format()" or     |
   |                | "string.Template" respectively. Defaults to   |
   |                | "'%'".                                        |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _level_        | Set the root logger level to the specified    |
   |                | level.                                        |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _stream_       | Use the specified stream to initialize the    |
   |                | "StreamHandler". Note that this argument is   |
   |                | incompatible with _filename_ - if both are    |
   |                | present, a "ValueError" is raised.            |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _handlers_     | If specified, this should be an iterable of   |
   |                | already created handlers to add to the root   |
   |                | logger. Any handlers which don’t already have |
   |                | a formatter set will be assigned the default  |
   |                | formatter created in this function. Note that |
   |                | this argument is incompatible with _filename_ |
   |                | or _stream_ - if both are present, a          |
   |                | "ValueError" is raised.                       |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _force_        | If this keyword argument is specified as      |
   |                | true, any existing handlers attached to the   |
   |                | root logger are removed and closed, before    |
   |                | carrying out the configuration as specified   |
   |                | by the other arguments.                       |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _encoding_     | If this keyword argument is specified along   |
   |                | with _filename_, its value is used when the   |
   |                | "FileHandler" is created, and thus used when  |
   |                | opening the output file.                      |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | _errors_       | If this keyword argument is specified along   |
   |                | with _filename_, its value is used when the   |
   |                | "FileHandler" is created, and thus used when  |
   |                | opening the output file. If not specified,    |
   |                | the value ‘backslashreplace’ is used. Note    |
   |                | that if "None" is specified, it will be       |
   |                | passed as such to "open()", which means that  |
   |                | it will be treated the same as passing        |
   |                | ‘errors’.                                     |
   +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   Changed in version 3.2: The _style_ argument was added.

   Changed in version 3.3: The _handlers_ argument was added.
   Additional checks were added to catch situations where incompatible
   arguments are specified (e.g. _handlers_ together with _stream_ or
   _filename_, or _stream_ together with _filename_).

   Changed in version 3.8: The _force_ argument was added.

   Changed in version 3.9: The _encoding_ and _errors_ arguments were
   added.

logging.shutdown()                           *shutdown()..logging.txt*

   Informs the logging system to perform an orderly shutdown by
   flushing and closing all handlers. This should be called at
   application exit and no further use of the logging system should be
   made after this call.

   When the logging module is imported, it registers this function as
   an exit handler (see "atexit"), so normally there’s no need to do
   that manually.

logging.setLoggerClass(klass)          *setLoggerClass()..logging.txt*

   Tells the logging system to use the class _klass_ when
   instantiating a logger. The class should define "__init__()" such
   that only a name argument is required, and the "__init__()" should
   call "Logger.__init__()". This function is typically called before
   any loggers are instantiated by applications which need to use
   custom logger behavior. After this call, as at any other time, do
   not instantiate loggers directly using the subclass: continue to
   use the "logging.getLogger()" API to get your loggers.

                                  *setLogRecordFactory()..logging.txt*
logging.setLogRecordFactory(factory)

   Set a callable which is used to create a "LogRecord".

   Parameters:
      **factory** – The factory callable to be used to instantiate a
      log record.

   New in version 3.2: This function has been provided, along with
   "getLogRecordFactory()", to allow developers more control over how
   the "LogRecord" representing a logging event is constructed.

   The factory has the following signature:

   "factory(name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None,
   sinfo=None, **kwargs)"

      name:
         The logger name.

      level:
         The logging level (numeric).

      fn:
         The full pathname of the file where the logging call was
         made.

      lno:
         The line number in the file where the logging call was made.

      msg:
         The logging message.

      args:
         The arguments for the logging message.

      exc_info:
         An exception tuple, or "None".

      func:
         The name of the function or method which invoked the logging
         call.

      sinfo:
         A stack traceback such as is provided by
         "traceback.print_stack()", showing the call hierarchy.

      kwargs:
         Additional keyword arguments.


Module-Level Attributes
=======================

logging.lastResort                           *lastResort..logging.txt*

   A “handler of last resort” is available through this attribute.
   This is a "StreamHandler" writing to "sys.stderr" with a level of
   "WARNING", and is used to handle logging events in the absence of
   any logging configuration. The end result is to just print the
   message to "sys.stderr". This replaces the earlier error message
   saying that “no handlers could be found for logger XYZ”. If you
   need the earlier behaviour for some reason, "lastResort" can be set
   to "None".

   New in version 3.2.


Integration with the warnings module
====================================

The "captureWarnings()" function can be used to integrate "logging"
with the "warnings" module.

logging.captureWarnings(capture)      *captureWarnings()..logging.txt*

   This function is used to turn the capture of warnings by logging on
   and off.

   If _capture_ is "True", warnings issued by the "warnings" module
   will be redirected to the logging system. Specifically, a warning
   will be formatted using "warnings.formatwarning()" and the
   resulting string logged to a logger named "'py.warnings'" with a
   severity of "WARNING".

   If _capture_ is "False", the redirection of warnings to the logging
   system will stop, and warnings will be redirected to their original
   destinations (i.e. those in effect before "captureWarnings(True)"
   was called).

  **PEP 282** - A Logging System
     The proposal which described this feature for inclusion in the
     Python standard library.

  Original Python logging package
     This is the original source for the "logging" package.  The
     version of the package available from this site is suitable for
     use with Python 1.5.2, 2.1.x and 2.2.x, which do not include the
     "logging" package in the standard library.
