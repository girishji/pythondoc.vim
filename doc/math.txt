"math" — Mathematical functions
*******************************

======================================================================

This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by
the C standard.

These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions
of the same name from the "cmath" module if you require support for
complex numbers.  The distinction between functions which support
complex numbers and those which don’t is made since most users do not
want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand
complex numbers.  Receiving an exception instead of a complex result
allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a
parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was
generated in the first place.

The following functions are provided by this module.  Except when
explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.


Number-theoretic and representation functions
=============================================

math.ceil(x)                                        *ceil()..math.txt*

   Return the ceiling of _x_, the smallest integer greater than or
   equal to _x_. If _x_ is not a float, delegates to "x.__ceil__",
   which should return an "Integral" value.

math.comb(n, k)                                     *comb()..math.txt*

   Return the number of ways to choose _k_ items from _n_ items
   without repetition and without order.

   Evaluates to "n! / (k! * (n - k)!)" when "k <= n" and evaluates to
   zero when "k > n".

   Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to
   the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of "(1 + x)ⁿ".

   Raises "TypeError" if either of the arguments are not integers.
   Raises "ValueError" if either of the arguments are negative.

   New in version 3.8.

math.copysign(x, y)                             *copysign()..math.txt*

   Return a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of _x_ but the
   sign of _y_.  On platforms that support signed zeros,
   "copysign(1.0, -0.0)" returns _-1.0_.

math.fabs(x)                                        *fabs()..math.txt*

   Return the absolute value of _x_.

math.factorial(n)                              *factorial()..math.txt*

   Return _n_ factorial as an integer.  Raises "ValueError" if _n_ is
   not integral or is negative.

   Changed in version 3.10: Floats with integral values (like "5.0")
   are no longer accepted.

math.floor(x)                                      *floor()..math.txt*

   Return the floor of _x_, the largest integer less than or equal to
   _x_.  If _x_ is not a float, delegates to "x.__floor__", which
   should return an "Integral" value.

math.fmod(x, y)                                     *fmod()..math.txt*

   Return "fmod(x, y)", as defined by the platform C library. Note
   that the Python expression "x % y" may not return the same result.
   The intent of the C standard is that "fmod(x, y)" be exactly
   (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to "x - n*y" for some
   integer _n_ such that the result has the same sign as _x_ and
   magnitude less than "abs(y)".  Python’s "x % y" returns a result
   with the sign of _y_ instead, and may not be exactly computable for
   float arguments. For example, "fmod(-1e-100, 1e100)" is "-1e-100",
   but the result of Python’s "-1e-100 % 1e100" is "1e100-1e-100",
   which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the
   surprising "1e100".  For this reason, function "fmod()" is
   generally preferred when working with floats, while Python’s "x %
   y" is preferred when working with integers.

math.frexp(x)                                      *frexp()..math.txt*

   Return the mantissa and exponent of _x_ as the pair "(m, e)".  _m_
   is a float and _e_ is an integer such that "x == m * 2**e" exactly.
   If _x_ is zero, returns "(0.0, 0)", otherwise "0.5 <= abs(m) < 1".
   This is used to “pick apart” the internal representation of a float
   in a portable way.

math.fsum(iterable)                                 *fsum()..math.txt*

   Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable.
   Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial
   sums.

   The algorithm’s accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees
   and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even.  On some
   non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended
   precision addition and may occasionally double-round an
   intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit.

   For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN
   cookbook recipes for accurate floating point summation.

math.gcd(*integers)                                  *gcd()..math.txt*

   Return the greatest common divisor of the specified integer
   arguments. If any of the arguments is nonzero, then the returned
   value is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of all
   arguments.  If all arguments are zero, then the returned value is
   "0".  "gcd()" without arguments returns "0".

   New in version 3.5.

   Changed in version 3.9: Added support for an arbitrary number of
   arguments. Formerly, only two arguments were supported.

                                                 *isclose()..math.txt*
math.isclose(a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)

   Return "True" if the values _a_ and _b_ are close to each other and
   "False" otherwise.

   Whether or not two values are considered close is determined
   according to given absolute and relative tolerances.

   _rel_tol_ is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed
   difference between _a_ and _b_, relative to the larger absolute
   value of _a_ or _b_. For example, to set a tolerance of 5%, pass
   "rel_tol=0.05".  The default tolerance is "1e-09", which assures
   that the two values are the same within about 9 decimal digits.
   _rel_tol_ must be greater than zero.

   _abs_tol_ is the minimum absolute tolerance – useful for
   comparisons near zero. _abs_tol_ must be at least zero.

   If no errors occur, the result will be: "abs(a-b) <= max(rel_tol *
   max(abs(a), abs(b)), abs_tol)".

   The IEEE 754 special values of "NaN", "inf", and "-inf" will be
   handled according to IEEE rules.  Specifically, "NaN" is not
   considered close to any other value, including "NaN".  "inf" and
   "-inf" are only considered close to themselves.

   New in version 3.5.

   See also: **PEP 485** – A function for testing approximate equality

math.isfinite(x)                                *isfinite()..math.txt*

   Return "True" if _x_ is neither an infinity nor a NaN, and "False"
   otherwise.  (Note that "0.0" _is_ considered finite.)

   New in version 3.2.

math.isinf(x)                                      *isinf()..math.txt*

   Return "True" if _x_ is a positive or negative infinity, and
   "False" otherwise.

math.isnan(x)                                      *isnan()..math.txt*

   Return "True" if _x_ is a NaN (not a number), and "False"
   otherwise.

math.isqrt(n)                                      *isqrt()..math.txt*

   Return the integer square root of the nonnegative integer _n_. This
   is the floor of the exact square root of _n_, or equivalently the
   greatest integer _a_ such that _a_² ≤ _n_.

   For some applications, it may be more convenient to have the least
   integer _a_ such that _n_ ≤ _a_², or in other words the ceiling of
   the exact square root of _n_. For positive _n_, this can be
   computed using "a = 1 + isqrt(n - 1)".

   New in version 3.8.

math.lcm(*integers)                                  *lcm()..math.txt*

   Return the least common multiple of the specified integer
   arguments. If all arguments are nonzero, then the returned value is
   the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all arguments.
   If any of the arguments is zero, then the returned value is "0".
   "lcm()" without arguments returns "1".

   New in version 3.9.

math.ldexp(x, i)                                   *ldexp()..math.txt*

   Return "x * (2**i)".  This is essentially the inverse of function
   "frexp()".

math.modf(x)                                        *modf()..math.txt*

   Return the fractional and integer parts of _x_.  Both results carry
   the sign of _x_ and are floats.

math.nextafter(x, y, steps=1)                  *nextafter()..math.txt*

   Return the floating-point value _steps_ steps after _x_ towards
   _y_.

   If _x_ is equal to _y_, return _y_, unless _steps_ is zero.

   Examples:

   * "math.nextafter(x, math.inf)" goes up: towards positive infinity.

   * "math.nextafter(x, -math.inf)" goes down: towards minus infinity.

   * "math.nextafter(x, 0.0)" goes towards zero.

   * "math.nextafter(x, math.copysign(math.inf, x))" goes away from
     zero.

   See also "math.ulp()".

   Changed in version 3.12: Added the _steps_ argument.

   New in version 3.9.

math.perm(n, k=None)                                *perm()..math.txt*

   Return the number of ways to choose _k_ items from _n_ items
   without repetition and with order.

   Evaluates to "n! / (n - k)!" when "k <= n" and evaluates to zero
   when "k > n".

   If _k_ is not specified or is None, then _k_ defaults to _n_ and
   the function returns "n!".

   Raises "TypeError" if either of the arguments are not integers.
   Raises "ValueError" if either of the arguments are negative.

   New in version 3.8.

math.prod(iterable, *, start=1)                     *prod()..math.txt*

   Calculate the product of all the elements in the input _iterable_.
   The default _start_ value for the product is "1".

   When the iterable is empty, return the start value.  This function
   is intended specifically for use with numeric values and may reject
   non-numeric types.

   New in version 3.8.

math.remainder(x, y)                           *remainder()..math.txt*

   Return the IEEE 754-style remainder of _x_ with respect to _y_.
   For finite _x_ and finite nonzero _y_, this is the difference "x -
   n*y", where "n" is the closest integer to the exact value of the
   quotient "x / y".  If "x / y" is exactly halfway between two
   consecutive integers, the nearest _even_ integer is used for "n".
   The remainder "r = remainder(x, y)" thus always satisfies "abs(r)
   <= 0.5 * abs(y)".

   Special cases follow IEEE 754: in particular, "remainder(x,
   math.inf)" is _x_ for any finite _x_, and "remainder(x, 0)" and
   "remainder(math.inf, x)" raise "ValueError" for any non-NaN _x_. If
   the result of the remainder operation is zero, that zero will have
   the same sign as _x_.

   On platforms using IEEE 754 binary floating-point, the result of
   this operation is always exactly representable: no rounding error
   is introduced.

   New in version 3.7.

math.sumprod(p, q)                               *sumprod()..math.txt*

   Return the sum of products of values from two iterables _p_ and
   _q_.

   Raises "ValueError" if the inputs do not have the same length.

   Roughly equivalent to:
>
      sum(itertools.starmap(operator.mul, zip(p, q, strict=True)))
<
   For float and mixed int/float inputs, the intermediate products and
   sums are computed with extended precision.

   New in version 3.12.

math.trunc(x)                                      *trunc()..math.txt*

   Return _x_ with the fractional part removed, leaving the integer
   part.  This rounds toward 0: "trunc()" is equivalent to "floor()"
   for positive _x_, and equivalent to "ceil()" for negative _x_. If
   _x_ is not a float, delegates to "x.__trunc__", which should return
   an "Integral" value.

math.ulp(x)                                          *ulp()..math.txt*

   Return the value of the least significant bit of the float _x_:

   * If _x_ is a NaN (not a number), return _x_.

   * If _x_ is negative, return "ulp(-x)".

   * If _x_ is a positive infinity, return _x_.

   * If _x_ is equal to zero, return the smallest positive
     _denormalized_ representable float (smaller than the minimum
     positive _normalized_ float, "sys.float_info.min").

   * If _x_ is equal to the largest positive representable float,
     return the value of the least significant bit of _x_, such that
     the first float smaller than _x_ is "x - ulp(x)".

   * Otherwise (_x_ is a positive finite number), return the value of
     the least significant bit of _x_, such that the first float
     bigger than _x_ is "x + ulp(x)".

   ULP stands for “Unit in the Last Place”.

   See also "math.nextafter()" and "sys.float_info.epsilon".

   New in version 3.9.

Note that "frexp()" and "modf()" have a different call/return pattern
than their C equivalents: they take a single argument and return a
pair of values, rather than returning their second return value
through an ‘output parameter’ (there is no such thing in Python).

For the "ceil()", "floor()", and "modf()" functions, note that _all_
floating-point numbers of sufficiently large magnitude are exact
integers. Python floats typically carry no more than 53 bits of
precision (the same as the platform C double type), in which case any
float _x_ with "abs(x) >= 2**52" necessarily has no fractional bits.


Power and logarithmic functions
===============================

math.cbrt(x)                                        *cbrt()..math.txt*

   Return the cube root of _x_.

   New in version 3.11.

math.exp(x)                                          *exp()..math.txt*

   Return _e_ raised to the power _x_, where _e_ = 2.718281… is the
   base of natural logarithms.  This is usually more accurate than
   "math.e ** x" or "pow(math.e, x)".

math.exp2(x)                                        *exp2()..math.txt*

   Return _2_ raised to the power _x_.

   New in version 3.11.

math.expm1(x)                                      *expm1()..math.txt*

   Return _e_ raised to the power _x_, minus 1.  Here _e_ is the base
   of natural logarithms.  For small floats _x_, the subtraction in
   "exp(x) - 1" can result in a significant loss of precision; the
   "expm1()" function provides a way to compute this quantity to full
   precision:

   >>> from math import exp, expm1
   >>> exp(1e-5) - 1  # gives result accurate to 11 places
   1.0000050000069649e-05
   >>> expm1(1e-5)    # result accurate to full precision
   1.0000050000166668e-05

   New in version 3.2.

math.log(x[, base])                                  *log()..math.txt*

   With one argument, return the natural logarithm of _x_ (to base
   _e_).

   With two arguments, return the logarithm of _x_ to the given
   _base_, calculated as "log(x)/log(base)".

math.log1p(x)                                      *log1p()..math.txt*

   Return the natural logarithm of _1+x_ (base _e_). The result is
   calculated in a way which is accurate for _x_ near zero.

math.log2(x)                                        *log2()..math.txt*

   Return the base-2 logarithm of _x_. This is usually more accurate
   than "log(x, 2)".

   New in version 3.3.

   See also:

     "int.bit_length()" returns the number of bits necessary to
     represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading
     zeros.

math.log10(x)                                      *log10()..math.txt*

   Return the base-10 logarithm of _x_.  This is usually more accurate
   than "log(x, 10)".

math.pow(x, y)                                       *pow()..math.txt*

   Return "x" raised to the power "y".  Exceptional cases follow the
   IEEE 754 standard as far as possible.  In particular, "pow(1.0, x)"
   and "pow(x, 0.0)" always return "1.0", even when "x" is a zero or a
   NaN.  If both "x" and "y" are finite, "x" is negative, and "y" is
   not an integer then "pow(x, y)" is undefined, and raises
   "ValueError".

   Unlike the built-in "**" operator, "math.pow()" converts both its
   arguments to type "float".  Use "**" or the built-in "pow()"
   function for computing exact integer powers.

   Changed in version 3.11: The special cases "pow(0.0, -inf)" and
   "pow(-0.0, -inf)" were changed to return "inf" instead of raising
   "ValueError", for consistency with IEEE 754.

math.sqrt(x)                                        *sqrt()..math.txt*

   Return the square root of _x_.


Trigonometric functions
=======================

math.acos(x)                                        *acos()..math.txt*

   Return the arc cosine of _x_, in radians. The result is between "0"
   and "pi".

math.asin(x)                                        *asin()..math.txt*

   Return the arc sine of _x_, in radians. The result is between
   "-pi/2" and "pi/2".

math.atan(x)                                        *atan()..math.txt*

   Return the arc tangent of _x_, in radians. The result is between
   "-pi/2" and "pi/2".

math.atan2(y, x)                                   *atan2()..math.txt*

   Return "atan(y / x)", in radians. The result is between "-pi" and
   "pi". The vector in the plane from the origin to point "(x, y)"
   makes this angle with the positive X axis. The point of "atan2()"
   is that the signs of both inputs are known to it, so it can compute
   the correct quadrant for the angle. For example, "atan(1)" and
   "atan2(1, 1)" are both "pi/4", but "atan2(-1, -1)" is "-3*pi/4".

math.cos(x)                                          *cos()..math.txt*

   Return the cosine of _x_ radians.

math.dist(p, q)                                     *dist()..math.txt*

   Return the Euclidean distance between two points _p_ and _q_, each
   given as a sequence (or iterable) of coordinates.  The two points
   must have the same dimension.

   Roughly equivalent to:
>
      sqrt(sum((px - qx) ** 2.0 for px, qx in zip(p, q)))
<
   New in version 3.8.

math.hypot(*coordinates)                           *hypot()..math.txt*

   Return the Euclidean norm, "sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in coordinates))".
   This is the length of the vector from the origin to the point given
   by the coordinates.

   For a two dimensional point "(x, y)", this is equivalent to
   computing the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean
   theorem, "sqrt(x*x + y*y)".

   Changed in version 3.8: Added support for n-dimensional points.
   Formerly, only the two dimensional case was supported.

   Changed in version 3.10: Improved the algorithm’s accuracy so that
   the maximum error is under 1 ulp (unit in the last place).  More
   typically, the result is almost always correctly rounded to within
   1/2 ulp.

math.sin(x)                                          *sin()..math.txt*

   Return the sine of _x_ radians.

math.tan(x)                                          *tan()..math.txt*

   Return the tangent of _x_ radians.


Angular conversion
==================

math.degrees(x)                                  *degrees()..math.txt*

   Convert angle _x_ from radians to degrees.

math.radians(x)                                  *radians()..math.txt*

   Convert angle _x_ from degrees to radians.


Hyperbolic functions
====================

Hyperbolic functions are analogs of trigonometric functions that are
based on hyperbolas instead of circles.

math.acosh(x)                                      *acosh()..math.txt*

   Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of _x_.

math.asinh(x)                                      *asinh()..math.txt*

   Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of _x_.

math.atanh(x)                                      *atanh()..math.txt*

   Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of _x_.

math.cosh(x)                                        *cosh()..math.txt*

   Return the hyperbolic cosine of _x_.

math.sinh(x)                                        *sinh()..math.txt*

   Return the hyperbolic sine of _x_.

math.tanh(x)                                        *tanh()..math.txt*

   Return the hyperbolic tangent of _x_.


Special functions
=================

math.erf(x)                                          *erf()..math.txt*

   Return the error function at _x_.

   The "erf()" function can be used to compute traditional statistical
   functions such as the cumulative standard normal distribution:
>
      def phi(x):
          'Cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution'
          return (1.0 + erf(x / sqrt(2.0))) / 2.0

math.erfc(x)                                        *erfc()..math.txt*

   Return the complementary error function at _x_.  The complementary
   error function is defined as "1.0 - erf(x)".  It is used for large
   values of _x_ where a subtraction from one would cause a loss of
   significance.

math.gamma(x)                                      *gamma()..math.txt*

   Return the Gamma function at _x_.

   New in version 3.2.

math.lgamma(x)                                    *lgamma()..math.txt*

   Return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma
   function at _x_.

Constants
=========

math.pi                                                 *pi..math.txt*

   The mathematical constant _π_ = 3.141592…, to available precision.

math.e                                                   *e..math.txt*

   The mathematical constant _e_ = 2.718281…, to available precision.

math.tau                                               *tau..math.txt*

   The mathematical constant _τ_ = 6.283185…, to available precision.
   Tau is a circle constant equal to 2_π_, the ratio of a circle’s
   circumference to its radius. To learn more about Tau, check out Vi

   New in version 3.6.

math.inf                                               *inf..math.txt*

   A floating-point positive infinity.  (For negative infinity, use
   "-math.inf".)  Equivalent to the output of "float('inf')".

   New in version 3.5.

math.nan                                               *nan..math.txt*

   A floating-point “not a number” (NaN) value. Equivalent to the
   output of "float('nan')". Due to the requirements of the IEEE-754
   standard, "math.nan" and "float('nan')" are not considered to equal
   to any other numeric value, including themselves. To check whether
   a number is a NaN, use the "isnan()" function to test for NaNs
   instead of "is" or "==". Example:

   >>> import math
   >>> math.nan == math.nan
   False
   >>> float('nan') == float('nan')
   False
   >>> math.isnan(math.nan)
   True
   >>> math.isnan(float('nan'))
   True

   Changed in version 3.11: It is now always available.

**CPython implementation detail:** The "math" module consists mostly
of thin wrappers around the platform C math library functions.
Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of the C99 standard
where appropriate.  The current implementation will raise "ValueError"
for invalid operations like "sqrt(-1.0)" or "log(0.0)" (where C99
Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero), and
"OverflowError" for results that overflow (for example,
"exp(1000.0)").  A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions
above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that
case, most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex
F) there are some exceptions to this rule, for example
"pow(float('nan'), 0.0)" or "hypot(float('nan'), float('inf'))".

Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from
quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified.
Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet.
