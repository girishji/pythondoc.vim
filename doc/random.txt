"random" — Generate pseudo-random numbers
*****************************************

**Source code:** Lib/random.py

======================================================================

This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various
distributions.

For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences,
there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate
a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random
sampling without replacement.

On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal
(Gaussian), lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta
distributions. For generating distributions of angles, the von Mises
distribution is available.

Almost all module functions depend on the basic function "random()",
which generates a random float uniformly in the half-open range "0.0
<= X < 1.0". Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator.
It produces 53-bit precision floats and has a period of 2**19937-1.
The underlying implementation in C is both fast and threadsafe.  The
Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively tested random number
generators in existence.  However, being completely deterministic, it
is not suitable for all purposes, and is completely unsuitable for
cryptographic purposes.

The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a
hidden instance of the "random.Random" class.  You can instantiate
your own instances of "Random" to get generators that don’t share
state.

Class "Random" can also be subclassed if you want to use a different
basic generator of your own devising: in that case, override the
"random()", "seed()", "getstate()", and "setstate()" methods.
Optionally, a new generator can supply a "getrandbits()" method — this
allows "randrange()" to produce selections over an arbitrarily large
range.

The "random" module also provides the "SystemRandom" class which uses
the system function "os.urandom()" to generate random numbers from
sources provided by the operating system.

Warning:

  The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for
  security purposes.  For security or cryptographic uses, see the
  "secrets" module.

Bookkeeping functions
=====================

random.seed(a=None, version=2)                   *seed()..random.txt;*

   Initialize the random number generator.

   If _a_ is omitted or "None", the current system time is used.  If
   randomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are
   used instead of the system time (see the "os.urandom()" function
   for details on availability).

   If _a_ is an int, it is used directly.

   With version 2 (the default), a "str", "bytes", or "bytearray"
   object gets converted to an "int" and all of its bits are used.

   With version 1 (provided for reproducing random sequences from
   older versions of Python), the algorithm for "str" and "bytes"
   generates a narrower range of seeds.

   Changed in version 3.2: Moved to the version 2 scheme which uses
   all of the bits in a string seed.

   Changed in version 3.11: The _seed_ must be one of the following
   types: _NoneType_, "int", "float", "str", "bytes", or "bytearray".

random.getstate()                            *getstate()..random.txt;*

   Return an object capturing the current internal state of the
   generator.  This object can be passed to "setstate()" to restore
   the state.

random.setstate(state)                       *setstate()..random.txt;*

   _state_ should have been obtained from a previous call to
   "getstate()", and "setstate()" restores the internal state of the
   generator to what it was at the time "getstate()" was called.


Functions for bytes
===================

random.randbytes(n)                         *randbytes()..random.txt;*

   Generate _n_ random bytes.

   This method should not be used for generating security tokens. Use
   "secrets.token_bytes()" instead.

   New in version 3.9.


Functions for integers
======================

random.randrange(stop)                      *randrange()..random.txt;*
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])

   Return a randomly selected element from "range(start, stop, step)".

   This is roughly equivalent to "choice(range(start, stop, step))"
   but supports arbitrarily large ranges and is optimized for common
   cases.

   The positional argument pattern matches the "range()" function.

   Keyword arguments should not be used because they can be
   interpreted in unexpected ways. For example "randrange(start=100)"
   is interpreted as "randrange(0, 100, 1)".

   Changed in version 3.2: "randrange()" is more sophisticated about
   producing equally distributed values.  Formerly it used a style
   like "int(random()*n)" which could produce slightly uneven
   distributions.

   Changed in version 3.12: Automatic conversion of non-integer types
   is no longer supported. Calls such as "randrange(10.0)" and
   "randrange(Fraction(10, 1))" now raise a "TypeError".

random.randint(a, b)                          *randint()..random.txt;*

   Return a random integer _N_ such that "a <= N <= b".  Alias for
   "randrange(a, b+1)".

random.getrandbits(k)                     *getrandbits()..random.txt;*

   Returns a non-negative Python integer with _k_ random bits. This
   method is supplied with the Mersenne Twister generator and some
   other generators may also provide it as an optional part of the
   API. When available, "getrandbits()" enables "randrange()" to
   handle arbitrarily large ranges.

   Changed in version 3.9: This method now accepts zero for _k_.


Functions for sequences
=======================

random.choice(seq)                             *choice()..random.txt;*

   Return a random element from the non-empty sequence _seq_. If _seq_
   is empty, raises "IndexError".

                                              *choices()..random.txt;*
random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)

   Return a _k_ sized list of elements chosen from the _population_
   with replacement. If the _population_ is empty, raises
   "IndexError".

   If a _weights_ sequence is specified, selections are made according
   to the relative weights.  Alternatively, if a _cum_weights_
   sequence is given, the selections are made according to the
   cumulative weights (perhaps computed using
   "itertools.accumulate()").  For example, the relative weights "[10,
   5, 30, 5]" are equivalent to the cumulative weights "[10, 15, 45,
   50]".  Internally, the relative weights are converted to cumulative
   weights before making selections, so supplying the cumulative
   weights saves work.

   If neither _weights_ nor _cum_weights_ are specified, selections
   are made with equal probability.  If a weights sequence is
   supplied, it must be the same length as the _population_ sequence.
   It is a "TypeError" to specify both _weights_ and _cum_weights_.

   The _weights_ or _cum_weights_ can use any numeric type that
   interoperates with the "float" values returned by "random()" (that
   includes integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).
   Weights are assumed to be non-negative and finite.  A "ValueError"
   is raised if all weights are zero.

   For a given seed, the "choices()" function with equal weighting
   typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to
   "choice()".  The algorithm used by "choices()" uses floating point
   arithmetic for internal consistency and speed.  The algorithm used
   by "choice()" defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated
   selections to avoid small biases from round-off error.

   New in version 3.6.

   Changed in version 3.9: Raises a "ValueError" if all weights are
   zero.

random.shuffle(x)                             *shuffle()..random.txt;*

   Shuffle the sequence _x_ in place.

   To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list,
   use "sample(x, k=len(x))" instead.

   Note that even for small "len(x)", the total number of permutations
   of _x_ can quickly grow larger than the period of most random
   number generators. This implies that most permutations of a long
   sequence can never be generated.  For example, a sequence of length
   2080 is the largest that can fit within the period of the Mersenne
   Twister random number generator.

   Deprecated since version 3.9, removed in version 3.11: The optional
   parameter _random_.

random.sample(population, k, *, counts=None)   *sample()..random.txt;*

   Return a _k_ length list of unique elements chosen from the
   population sequence.  Used for random sampling without replacement.

   Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
   leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
   in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
   samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
   into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).

   Members of the population need not be _hashable_ or unique.  If the
   population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
   selection in the sample.

   Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the
   optional keyword-only _counts_ parameter.  For example,
   "sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5)" is equivalent to
   "sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'blue'], k=5)".

   To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a "range()" object
   as an argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient for
   sampling from a large population:  "sample(range(10000000), k=60)".

   If the sample size is larger than the population size, a
   "ValueError" is raised.

   Changed in version 3.9: Added the _counts_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.11: The _population_ must be a sequence.
   Automatic conversion of sets to lists is no longer supported.


Discrete distributions
======================

The following function generates a discrete distribution.

random.binomialvariate(n=1, p=0.5)    *binomialvariate()..random.txt;*

   Binomial distribution. Return the number of successes for _n_
   independent trials with the probability of success in each trial
   being _p_:

   Mathematically equivalent to:
>
      sum(random() < p for i in range(n))
<
   The number of trials _n_ should be a non-negative integer. The
   probability of success _p_ should be between "0.0 <= p <= 1.0". The
   result is an integer in the range "0 <= X <= n".

   New in version 3.12.


Real-valued distributions
=========================

The following functions generate specific real-valued distributions.
Function parameters are named after the corresponding variables in the
distribution’s equation, as used in common mathematical practice; most
of these equations can be found in any statistics text.

random.random()                                *random()..random.txt;*

   Return the next random floating point number in the range "0.0 <= X
   < 1.0"

random.uniform(a, b)                          *uniform()..random.txt;*

   Return a random floating point number _N_ such that "a <= N <= b"
   for "a <= b" and "b <= N <= a" for "b < a".

   The end-point value "b" may or may not be included in the range
   depending on floating-point rounding in the equation "a + (b-a) *
   random()".

random.triangular(low, high, mode)         *triangular()..random.txt;*

   Return a random floating point number _N_ such that "low <= N <=
   high" and with the specified _mode_ between those bounds.  The
   _low_ and _high_ bounds default to zero and one.  The _mode_
   argument defaults to the midpoint between the bounds, giving a
   symmetric distribution.

random.betavariate(alpha, beta)           *betavariate()..random.txt;*

   Beta distribution.  Conditions on the parameters are "alpha > 0"
   and "beta > 0". Returned values range between 0 and 1.

random.expovariate(lambd=1.0)             *expovariate()..random.txt;*

   Exponential distribution.  _lambd_ is 1.0 divided by the desired
   mean.  It should be nonzero.  (The parameter would be called
   “lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values
   range from 0 to positive infinity if _lambd_ is positive, and from
   negative infinity to 0 if _lambd_ is negative.

   Changed in version 3.12: Added the default value for "lambd".

random.gammavariate(alpha, beta)         *gammavariate()..random.txt;*

   Gamma distribution.  (_Not_ the gamma function!)  The shape and
   scale parameters, _alpha_ and _beta_, must have positive values.
   (Calling conventions vary and some sources define ‘beta’ as the
   inverse of the scale).

   The probability distribution function is:
>
                x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
      pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
                  math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
<
random.gauss(mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)                 *gauss()..random.txt;*

   Normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution. _mu_ is
   the mean, and _sigma_ is the standard deviation.  This is slightly
   faster than the "normalvariate()" function defined below.

   Multithreading note:  When two threads call this function
   simultaneously, it is possible that they will receive the same
   return value.  This can be avoided in three ways. 1) Have each
   thread use a different instance of the random number generator. 2)
   Put locks around all calls. 3) Use the slower, but thread-safe
   "normalvariate()" function instead.

   Changed in version 3.11: _mu_ and _sigma_ now have default
   arguments.

random.lognormvariate(mu, sigma)       *lognormvariate()..random.txt;*

   Log normal distribution.  If you take the natural logarithm of this
   distribution, you’ll get a normal distribution with mean _mu_ and
   standard deviation _sigma_.  _mu_ can have any value, and _sigma_
   must be greater than zero.

                                        *normalvariate()..random.txt;*
random.normalvariate(mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)

   Normal distribution.  _mu_ is the mean, and _sigma_ is the standard
   deviation.

   Changed in version 3.11: _mu_ and _sigma_ now have default
   arguments.

random.vonmisesvariate(mu, kappa)     *vonmisesvariate()..random.txt;*

   _mu_ is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*_pi_,
   and _kappa_ is the concentration parameter, which must be greater
   than or equal to zero.  If _kappa_ is equal to zero, this
   distribution reduces to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to
   2*_pi_.

random.paretovariate(alpha)             *paretovariate()..random.txt;*

   Pareto distribution.  _alpha_ is the shape parameter.

random.weibullvariate(alpha, beta)     *weibullvariate()..random.txt;*

   Weibull distribution.  _alpha_ is the scale parameter and _beta_ is
   the shape parameter.


Alternative Generator
=====================

class random.Random([seed])                      *Random..random.txt;*

   Class that implements the default pseudo-random number generator
   used by the "random" module.

   Deprecated since version 3.9, removed in version 3.11: Formerly the
   _seed_ could be any hashable object.  Now it is limited to:
   "NoneType", "int", "float", "str", "bytes", or "bytearray".

class random.SystemRandom([seed])          *SystemRandom..random.txt;*

   Class that uses the "os.urandom()" function for generating random
   numbers from sources provided by the operating system. Not
   available on all systems. Does not rely on software state, and
   sequences are not reproducible. Accordingly, the "seed()" method
   has no effect and is ignored. The "getstate()" and "setstate()"
   methods raise "NotImplementedError" if called.


Notes on Reproducibility
========================

Sometimes it is useful to be able to reproduce the sequences given by
a pseudo-random number generator.  By reusing a seed value, the same
sequence should be reproducible from run to run as long as multiple
threads are not running.

Most of the random module’s algorithms and seeding functions are
subject to change across Python versions, but two aspects are
guaranteed not to change:

* If a new seeding method is added, then a backward compatible seeder
  will be offered.

* The generator’s "random()" method will continue to produce the same
  sequence when the compatible seeder is given the same seed.

Recipes
=======

These recipes show how to efficiently make random selections from the
combinatoric iterators in the "itertools" module:
>
   def random_product(*args, repeat=1):
       "Random selection from itertools.product(*args, **kwds)"
       pools = [tuple(pool) for pool in args] * repeat
       return tuple(map(random.choice, pools))

   def random_permutation(iterable, r=None):
       "Random selection from itertools.permutations(iterable, r)"
       pool = tuple(iterable)
       r = len(pool) if r is None else r
       return tuple(random.sample(pool, r))

   def random_combination(iterable, r):
       "Random selection from itertools.combinations(iterable, r)"
       pool = tuple(iterable)
       n = len(pool)
       indices = sorted(random.sample(range(n), r))
       return tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)

   def random_combination_with_replacement(iterable, r):
       "Choose r elements with replacement.  Order the result to match the iterable."
       # Result will be in set(itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)).
       pool = tuple(iterable)
       n = len(pool)
       indices = sorted(random.choices(range(n), k=r))
       return tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)
<
The default "random()" returns multiples of 2⁻⁵³ in the range _0.0 ≤ x
< 1.0_.  All such numbers are evenly spaced and are exactly
representable as Python floats.  However, many other representable
floats in that interval are not possible selections.  For example,
"0.05954861408025609" isn’t an integer multiple of 2⁻⁵³.

The following recipe takes a different approach.  All floats in the
interval are possible selections.  The mantissa comes from a uniform
distribution of integers in the range _2⁵² ≤ mantissa < 2⁵³_.  The
exponent comes from a geometric distribution where exponents smaller
than _-53_ occur half as often as the next larger exponent.

The recipe is conceptually equivalent to an algorithm that chooses
from all the multiples of 2⁻¹⁰⁷⁴ in the range _0.0 ≤ x < 1.0_.  All
such numbers are evenly spaced, but most have to be rounded down to
the nearest representable Python float.  (The value 2⁻¹⁰⁷⁴ is the
smallest positive unnormalized float and is equal to "math.ulp(0.0)".)
