"resource" — Resource usage information
***************************************

======================================================================

This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling
system resources utilized by a program.

Availability: not Emscripten, not WASI.

This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms
"wasm32-emscripten" and "wasm32-wasi". See WebAssembly platforms for
more information.

Symbolic constants are used to specify particular system resources and
to request usage information about either the current process or its
children.

An "OSError" is raised on syscall failure.

exception resource.error                         *error..resource.txt*

   A deprecated alias of "OSError".

   Changed in version 3.3: Following **PEP 3151**, this class was made
   an alias of "OSError".


Resource Limits
===============

Resources usage can be limited using the "setrlimit()" function
described below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a
soft limit and a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and
may be lowered or raised by a process over time. The soft limit can
never exceed the hard limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any
value greater than the soft limit, but not raised. (Only processes
with the effective UID of the super-user can raise a hard limit.)

The specific resources that can be limited are system dependent. They
are described in the _getrlimit(2)_ man page.  The resources listed
below are supported when the underlying operating system supports
them; resources which cannot be checked or controlled by the operating
system are not defined in this module for those platforms.

resource.RLIM_INFINITY                   *RLIM_INFINITY..resource.txt*

   Constant used to represent the limit for an unlimited resource.

resource.getrlimit(resource)               *getrlimit()..resource.txt*

   Returns a tuple "(soft, hard)" with the current soft and hard
   limits of _resource_. Raises "ValueError" if an invalid resource is
   specified, or "error" if the underlying system call fails
   unexpectedly.

resource.setrlimit(resource, limits)       *setrlimit()..resource.txt*

   Sets new limits of consumption of _resource_. The _limits_ argument
   must be a tuple "(soft, hard)" of two integers describing the new
   limits. A value of "RLIM_INFINITY" can be used to request a limit
   that is unlimited.

   Raises "ValueError" if an invalid resource is specified, if the new
   soft limit exceeds the hard limit, or if a process tries to raise
   its hard limit. Specifying a limit of "RLIM_INFINITY" when the hard
   or system limit for that resource is not unlimited will result in a
   "ValueError".  A process with the effective UID of super-user can
   request any valid limit value, including unlimited, but
   "ValueError" will still be raised if the requested limit exceeds
   the system imposed limit.

   "setrlimit" may also raise "error" if the underlying system call
   fails.

   VxWorks only supports setting "RLIMIT_NOFILE".

   Raises an auditing event "resource.setrlimit" with arguments
   "resource", "limits".

resource.prlimit(pid, resource[, limits])    *prlimit()..resource.txt*

   Combines "setrlimit()" and "getrlimit()" in one function and
   supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary
   process. If _pid_ is 0, then the call applies to the current
   process. _resource_ and _limits_ have the same meaning as in
   "setrlimit()", except that _limits_ is optional.

   When _limits_ is not given the function returns the _resource_
   limit of the process _pid_. When _limits_ is given the _resource_
   limit of the process is set and the former resource limit is
   returned.

   Raises "ProcessLookupError" when _pid_ can’t be found and
   "PermissionError" when the user doesn’t have "CAP_SYS_RESOURCE" for
   the process.

   Raises an auditing event "resource.prlimit" with arguments "pid",
   "resource", "limits".

   Availability: Linux >= 2.6.36 with glibc >= 2.13.

   New in version 3.4.

These symbols define resources whose consumption can be controlled
using the "setrlimit()" and "getrlimit()" functions described below.
The values of these symbols are exactly the constants used by C
programs.

The Unix man page for _getrlimit(2)_ lists the available resources.
Note that not all systems use the same symbol or same value to denote
the same resource.  This module does not attempt to mask platform
differences — symbols not defined for a platform will not be available
from this module on that platform.

resource.RLIMIT_CORE                       *RLIMIT_CORE..resource.txt*

   The maximum size (in bytes) of a core file that the current process
   can create. This may result in the creation of a partial core file
   if a larger core would be required to contain the entire process
   image.

   The maximum amount of processor time (in seconds) that a process
   can use. If this limit is exceeded, a "SIGXCPU" signal is sent to
   the process. (See the "signal" module documentation for information
   about how to catch this signal and do something useful, e.g. flush
   open files to disk.)

Resource Usage
==============

These functions are used to retrieve resource usage information:

resource.getrusage(who)                    *getrusage()..resource.txt*

   This function returns an object that describes the resources
   consumed by either the current process or its children, as
   specified by the _who_ parameter.  The _who_ parameter should be
   specified using one of the "RUSAGE_*" constants described below.

   A simple example:
>
      from resource import *
      import time

      # a non CPU-bound task
      time.sleep(3)
      print(getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF))

      # a CPU-bound task
      for i in range(10 ** 8):
         _ = 1 + 1
      print(getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF))
<
   The fields of the return value each describe how a particular
   system resource has been used, e.g. amount of time spent running is
   user mode or number of times the process was swapped out of main
   memory. Some values are dependent on the clock tick internal, e.g.
   the amount of memory the process is using.

   For backward compatibility, the return value is also accessible as
   a tuple of 16 elements.

   The fields "ru_utime" and "ru_stime" of the return value are
   floating point values representing the amount of time spent
   executing in user mode and the amount of time spent executing in
   system mode, respectively. The remaining values are integers.
   Consult the _getrusage(2)_ man page for detailed information about
   these values. A brief summary is presented here:

   This function will raise a "ValueError" if an invalid _who_
   parameter is specified. It may also raise "error" exception in
   unusual circumstances.

resource.getpagesize()                   *getpagesize()..resource.txt*

   Returns the number of bytes in a system page. (This need not be the
   same as the hardware page size.)
