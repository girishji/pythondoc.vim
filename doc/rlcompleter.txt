"rlcompleter" — Completion function for GNU readline
****************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/rlcompleter.py

======================================================================

The "rlcompleter" module defines a completion function suitable for
the "readline" module by completing valid Python identifiers and
keywords.

When this module is imported on a Unix platform with the "readline"
module available, an instance of the "Completer" class is
automatically created and its "complete()" method is set as the
"readline" completer.

Example:
>
   >>> import rlcompleter
   >>> import readline
   >>> readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
   >>> readline. <TAB PRESSED>
   readline.__doc__          readline.get_line_buffer(  readline.read_init_file(
   readline.__file__         readline.insert_text(      readline.set_completer(
   readline.__name__         readline.parse_and_bind(
   >>> readline.
<
The "rlcompleter" module is designed for use with Python’s interactive
mode.  Unless Python is run with the "-S" option, the module is
automatically imported and configured (see Readline configuration).

On platforms without "readline", the "Completer" class defined by this
module can still be used for custom purposes.


Completer Objects
=================

Completer objects have the following method:

                               *Completer.complete()..rlcompleter.txt*
Completer.complete(text, state)

   Return the _state_th completion for _text_.

   If called for _text_ that doesn’t include a period character
   ("'.'"), it will complete from names currently defined in
   "__main__", "builtins" and keywords (as defined by the "keyword"
   module).

   If called for a dotted name, it will try to evaluate anything
   without obvious side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but
   it can generate calls to "__getattr__()") up to the last part, and
   find matches for the rest via the "dir()" function.  Any exception
   raised during the evaluation of the expression is caught, silenced
   and "None" is returned.
