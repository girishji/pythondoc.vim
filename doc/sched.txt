"sched" — Event scheduler
*************************

**Source code:** Lib/sched.py

======================================================================

The "sched" module defines a class which implements a general purpose
event scheduler:

                                                *scheduler..sched.txt*
class sched.scheduler(timefunc=time.monotonic, delayfunc=time.sleep)

   The "scheduler" class defines a generic interface to scheduling
   events. It needs two functions to actually deal with the “outside
   world” — _timefunc_ should be callable without arguments, and
   return  a number (the “time”, in any units whatsoever).  The
   _delayfunc_ function should be callable with one argument,
   compatible with the output of _timefunc_, and should delay that
   many time units. _delayfunc_ will also be called with the argument
   "0" after each event is run to allow other threads an opportunity
   to run in multi-threaded applications.

   Changed in version 3.3: _timefunc_ and _delayfunc_ parameters are
   optional.

   Changed in version 3.3: "scheduler" class can be safely used in
   multi-threaded environments.

Example:
>
   >>> import sched, time
   >>> s = sched.scheduler(time.monotonic, time.sleep)
   >>> def print_time(a='default'):
   ...     print("From print_time", time.time(), a)
   ...
   >>> def print_some_times():
   ...     print(time.time())
   ...     s.enter(10, 1, print_time)
   ...     s.enter(5, 2, print_time, argument=('positional',))
   ...     # despite having higher priority, 'keyword' runs after 'positional' as enter() is relative
   ...     s.enter(5, 1, print_time, kwargs={'a': 'keyword'})
   ...     s.enterabs(1_650_000_000, 10, print_time, argument=("first enterabs",))
   ...     s.enterabs(1_650_000_000, 5, print_time, argument=("second enterabs",))
   ...     s.run()
   ...     print(time.time())
   ...
   >>> print_some_times()
   1652342830.3640375
   From print_time 1652342830.3642538 second enterabs
   From print_time 1652342830.3643398 first enterabs
   From print_time 1652342835.3694863 positional
   From print_time 1652342835.3696074 keyword
   From print_time 1652342840.369612 default
   1652342840.3697174

Scheduler Objects
=================

"scheduler" instances have the following methods and attributes:

                                     *scheduler.enterabs()..sched.txt*
scheduler.enterabs(time, priority, action, argument=(), kwargs={})

   Schedule a new event. The _time_ argument should be a numeric type
   compatible with the return value of the _timefunc_ function passed
   to the constructor. Events scheduled for the same _time_ will be
   executed in the order of their _priority_. A lower number
   represents a higher priority.

   Executing the event means executing "action(*argument, **kwargs)".
   _argument_ is a sequence holding the positional arguments for
   _action_. _kwargs_ is a dictionary holding the keyword arguments
   for _action_.

   Return value is an event which may be used for later cancellation
   of the event (see "cancel()").

   Changed in version 3.3: _argument_ parameter is optional.

   Changed in version 3.3: _kwargs_ parameter was added.

                                        *scheduler.enter()..sched.txt*
scheduler.enter(delay, priority, action, argument=(), kwargs={})

   Schedule an event for _delay_ more time units. Other than the
   relative time, the other arguments, the effect and the return value
   are the same as those for "enterabs()".

   Changed in version 3.3: _argument_ parameter is optional.

   Changed in version 3.3: _kwargs_ parameter was added.

scheduler.cancel(event)                *scheduler.cancel()..sched.txt*

   Remove the event from the queue. If _event_ is not an event
   currently in the queue, this method will raise a "ValueError".

scheduler.empty()                       *scheduler.empty()..sched.txt*

   Return "True" if the event queue is empty.

scheduler.run(blocking=True)              *scheduler.run()..sched.txt*

   Run all scheduled events. This method will wait  (using the
   _delayfunc_ function passed to the constructor) for the next event,
   then execute it and so on until there are no more scheduled events.

   If _blocking_ is false executes the scheduled events due to expire
   soonest (if any) and then return the deadline of the next scheduled
   call in the scheduler (if any).

   Either _action_ or _delayfunc_ can raise an exception.  In either
   case, the scheduler will maintain a consistent state and propagate
   the exception.  If an exception is raised by _action_, the event
   will not be attempted in future calls to "run()".

   If a sequence of events takes longer to run than the time available
   before the next event, the scheduler will simply fall behind.  No
   events will be dropped; the calling code is responsible for
   canceling  events which are no longer pertinent.

   Changed in version 3.3: _blocking_ parameter was added.

scheduler.queue                           *scheduler.queue..sched.txt*

   Read-only attribute returning a list of upcoming events in the
   order they will be run.  Each event is shown as a _named tuple_
   with the following fields:  time, priority, action, argument,
   kwargs.
