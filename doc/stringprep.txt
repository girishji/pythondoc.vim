"stringprep" — Internet String Preparation
******************************************

**Source code:** Lib/stringprep.py

======================================================================

When identifying things (such as host names) in the internet, it is
often necessary to compare such identifications for “equality”.
Exactly how this comparison is executed may depend on the application
domain, e.g. whether it should be case-insensitive or not. It may be
also necessary to restrict the possible identifications, to allow only
identifications consisting of “printable” characters.

**RFC 3454** defines a procedure for “preparing” Unicode strings in
internet protocols. Before passing strings onto the wire, they are
processed with the preparation procedure, after which they have a
certain normalized form. The RFC defines a set of tables, which can be
combined into profiles. Each profile must define which tables it uses,
and what other optional parts of the "stringprep" procedure are part
of the profile. One example of a "stringprep" profile is "nameprep",
which is used for internationalized domain names.

The module "stringprep" only exposes the tables from **RFC 3454**. As
these tables would be very large to represent as dictionaries or
lists, the module uses the Unicode character database internally. The
module source code itself was generated using the "mkstringprep.py"
utility.

As a result, these tables are exposed as functions, not as data
structures. There are two kinds of tables in the RFC: sets and
mappings. For a set, "stringprep" provides the “characteristic
function”, i.e. a function that returns "True" if the parameter is
part of the set. For mappings, it provides the mapping function: given
the key, it returns the associated value. Below is a list of all
functions available in the module.

stringprep.in_table_a1(code)           *in_table_a1()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableA.1 (Unassigned code points in
   Unicode 3.2).

stringprep.in_table_b1(code)           *in_table_b1()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableB.1 (Commonly mapped to
   nothing).

stringprep.map_table_b2(code)         *map_table_b2()..stringprep.txt*

   Return the mapped value for _code_ according to tableB.2 (Mapping
   for case-folding used with NFKC).

stringprep.map_table_b3(code)         *map_table_b3()..stringprep.txt*

   Return the mapped value for _code_ according to tableB.3 (Mapping
   for case-folding used with no normalization).

stringprep.in_table_c11(code)         *in_table_c11()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.1.1  (ASCII space
   characters).

stringprep.in_table_c12(code)         *in_table_c12()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.1.2  (Non-ASCII space
   characters).

                                  *in_table_c11_c12()..stringprep.txt*
stringprep.in_table_c11_c12(code)

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.1  (Space characters, union
   of C.1.1 and C.1.2).

stringprep.in_table_c21(code)         *in_table_c21()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.2.1  (ASCII control
   characters).

stringprep.in_table_c22(code)         *in_table_c22()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.2.2  (Non-ASCII control
   characters).

                                  *in_table_c21_c22()..stringprep.txt*
stringprep.in_table_c21_c22(code)

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.2  (Control characters, union
   of C.2.1 and C.2.2).

stringprep.in_table_c3(code)           *in_table_c3()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.3  (Private use).

stringprep.in_table_c4(code)           *in_table_c4()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.4  (Non-character code
   points).

stringprep.in_table_c5(code)           *in_table_c5()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.5  (Surrogate codes).

stringprep.in_table_c6(code)           *in_table_c6()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.6  (Inappropriate for plain
   text).

stringprep.in_table_c7(code)           *in_table_c7()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.7  (Inappropriate for
   canonical representation).

stringprep.in_table_c8(code)           *in_table_c8()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.8  (Change display properties
   or are deprecated).

stringprep.in_table_c9(code)           *in_table_c9()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableC.9  (Tagging characters).

stringprep.in_table_d1(code)           *in_table_d1()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableD.1  (Characters with
   bidirectional property “R” or “AL”).

stringprep.in_table_d2(code)           *in_table_d2()..stringprep.txt*

   Determine whether _code_ is in tableD.2  (Characters with
   bidirectional property “L”).
