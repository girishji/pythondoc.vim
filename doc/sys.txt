"sys" — System-specific parameters and functions
************************************************

======================================================================

This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by
the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the
interpreter. It is always available.

sys.abiflags                                      *abiflags..sys.txt;*

   On POSIX systems where Python was built with the standard
   "configure" script, this contains the ABI flags as specified by
   **PEP 3149**.

   Changed in version 3.8: Default flags became an empty string ("m"
   flag for pymalloc has been removed).

   New in version 3.2.

sys.addaudithook(hook)                      *addaudithook()..sys.txt;*

   Append the callable _hook_ to the list of active auditing hooks for
   the current (sub)interpreter.

   When an auditing event is raised through the "sys.audit()"
   function, each hook will be called in the order it was added with
   the event name and the tuple of arguments. Native hooks added by
   "PySys_AddAuditHook()" are called first, followed by hooks added in
   the current (sub)interpreter.  Hooks can then log the event, raise
   an exception to abort the operation, or terminate the process
   entirely.

   Note that audit hooks are primarily for collecting information
   about internal or otherwise unobservable actions, whether by Python
   or libraries written in Python. They are not suitable for
   implementing a “sandbox”. In particular, malicious code can
   trivially disable or bypass hooks added using this function. At a
   minimum, any security-sensitive hooks must be added using the C API
   "PySys_AddAuditHook()" before initialising the runtime, and any
   modules allowing arbitrary memory modification (such as "ctypes")
   should be completely removed or closely monitored.

   Calling "sys.addaudithook()" will itself raise an auditing event
   named "sys.addaudithook" with no arguments. If any existing hooks
   raise an exception derived from "RuntimeError", the new hook will
   not be added and the exception suppressed. As a result, callers
   cannot assume that their hook has been added unless they control
   all existing hooks.

   See the audit events table for all events raised by CPython, and
   **PEP 578** for the original design discussion.

   New in version 3.8.

   Changed in version 3.8.1: Exceptions derived from "Exception" but
   not "RuntimeError" are no longer suppressed.

   **CPython implementation detail:** When tracing is enabled (see
   "settrace()"), Python hooks are only traced if the callable has a
   "__cantrace__" member that is set to a true value. Otherwise, trace
   functions will skip the hook.

sys.argv                                              *argv..sys.txt;*

   The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script.
   "argv[0]" is the script name (it is operating system dependent
   whether this is a full pathname or not).  If the command was
   executed using the "-c" command line option to the interpreter,
   "argv[0]" is set to the string "'-c'".  If no script name was
   passed to the Python interpreter, "argv[0]" is the empty string.

   To loop over the standard input, or the list of files given on the
   command line, see the "fileinput" module.

   See also "sys.orig_argv".

   Note:

     On Unix, command line arguments are passed by bytes from OS.
     Python decodes them with filesystem encoding and
     “surrogateescape” error handler. When you need original bytes,
     you can get it by "[os.fsencode(arg) for arg in sys.argv]".

sys.audit(event, *args)                            *audit()..sys.txt;*

   Raise an auditing event and trigger any active auditing hooks.
   _event_ is a string identifying the event, and _args_ may contain
   optional arguments with more information about the event.  The
   number and types of arguments for a given event are considered a
   public and stable API and should not be modified between releases.

   For example, one auditing event is named "os.chdir". This event has
   one argument called _path_ that will contain the requested new
   working directory.

   "sys.audit()" will call the existing auditing hooks, passing the
   event name and arguments, and will re-raise the first exception
   from any hook. In general, if an exception is raised, it should not
   be handled and the process should be terminated as quickly as
   possible. This allows hook implementations to decide how to respond
   to particular events: they can merely log the event or abort the
   operation by raising an exception.

   Hooks are added using the "sys.addaudithook()" or
   "PySys_AddAuditHook()" functions.

   The native equivalent of this function is "PySys_Audit()". Using
   the native function is preferred when possible.

   See the audit events table for all events raised by CPython.

   New in version 3.8.

sys.base_exec_prefix                      *base_exec_prefix..sys.txt;*

   Set during Python startup, before "site.py" is run, to the same
   value as "exec_prefix". If not running in a virtual environment,
   the values will stay the same; if "site.py" finds that a virtual
   environment is in use, the values of "prefix" and "exec_prefix"
   will be changed to point to the virtual environment, whereas
   "base_prefix" and "base_exec_prefix" will remain pointing to the
   base Python installation (the one which the virtual environment was
   created from).

   New in version 3.3.

sys.base_prefix                                *base_prefix..sys.txt;*

   Set during Python startup, before "site.py" is run, to the same
   value as "prefix". If not running in a virtual environment, the
   values will stay the same; if "site.py" finds that a virtual
   environment is in use, the values of "prefix" and "exec_prefix"
   will be changed to point to the virtual environment, whereas
   "base_prefix" and "base_exec_prefix" will remain pointing to the
   base Python installation (the one which the virtual environment was
   created from).

   New in version 3.3.

sys.byteorder                                    *byteorder..sys.txt;*

   An indicator of the native byte order.  This will have the value
   "'big'" on big-endian (most-significant byte first) platforms, and
   "'little'" on little-endian (least-significant byte first)
   platforms.

sys.builtin_module_names              *builtin_module_names..sys.txt;*

   A tuple of strings containing the names of all modules that are
   compiled into this Python interpreter.  (This information is not
   available in any other way — "modules.keys()" only lists the
   imported modules.)

   See also the "sys.stdlib_module_names" list.

sys.call_tracing(func, args)                *call_tracing()..sys.txt;*

   Call "func(*args)", while tracing is enabled.  The tracing state is
   saved, and restored afterwards.  This is intended to be called from
   a debugger from a checkpoint, to recursively debug some other code.

sys.copyright                                    *copyright..sys.txt;*

   A string containing the copyright pertaining to the Python
   interpreter.

sys._clear_type_cache()                *_clear_type_cache()..sys.txt;*

   Clear the internal type cache. The type cache is used to speed up
   attribute and method lookups. Use the function _only_ to drop
   unnecessary references during reference leak debugging.

   This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes
   only.

sys._current_frames()                    *_current_frames()..sys.txt;*

   Return a dictionary mapping each thread’s identifier to the topmost
   stack frame currently active in that thread at the time the
   function is called. Note that functions in the "traceback" module
   can build the call stack given such a frame.

   This is most useful for debugging deadlock:  this function does not
   require the deadlocked threads’ cooperation, and such threads’ call
   stacks are frozen for as long as they remain deadlocked.  The frame
   returned for a non-deadlocked thread may bear no relationship to
   that thread’s current activity by the time calling code examines
   the frame.

   This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes
   only.

   Raises an auditing event "sys._current_frames" with no arguments.

sys._current_exceptions()            *_current_exceptions()..sys.txt;*

   Return a dictionary mapping each thread’s identifier to the topmost
   exception currently active in that thread at the time the function
   is called. If a thread is not currently handling an exception, it
   is not included in the result dictionary.

   This is most useful for statistical profiling.

   This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes
   only.

   Raises an auditing event "sys._current_exceptions" with no
   arguments.

   Changed in version 3.12: Each value in the dictionary is now a
   single exception instance, rather than a 3-tuple as returned from
   "sys.exc_info()".

sys.breakpointhook()                      *breakpointhook()..sys.txt;*

   This hook function is called by built-in "breakpoint()".  By
   default, it drops you into the "pdb" debugger, but it can be set to
   any other function so that you can choose which debugger gets used.

   The signature of this function is dependent on what it calls.  For
   example, the default binding (e.g. "pdb.set_trace()") expects no
   arguments, but you might bind it to a function that expects
   additional arguments (positional and/or keyword).  The built-in
   "breakpoint()" function passes its "*args" and "**kws" straight
   through.  Whatever "breakpointhooks()" returns is returned from
   "breakpoint()".

   The default implementation first consults the environment variable
   "PYTHONBREAKPOINT".  If that is set to ""0"" then this function
   returns immediately; i.e. it is a no-op.  If the environment
   variable is not set, or is set to the empty string,
   "pdb.set_trace()" is called. Otherwise this variable should name a
   function to run, using Python’s dotted-import nomenclature, e.g.
   "package.subpackage.module.function". In this case,
   "package.subpackage.module" would be imported and the resulting
   module must have a callable named "function()".  This is run,
   passing in "*args" and "**kws", and whatever "function()" returns,
   "sys.breakpointhook()" returns to the built-in "breakpoint()"
   function.

   Note that if anything goes wrong while importing the callable named
   by "PYTHONBREAKPOINT", a "RuntimeWarning" is reported and the
   breakpoint is ignored.

   Also note that if "sys.breakpointhook()" is overridden
   programmatically, "PYTHONBREAKPOINT" is _not_ consulted.

   New in version 3.7.

sys._debugmallocstats()                *_debugmallocstats()..sys.txt;*

   Print low-level information to stderr about the state of CPython’s
   memory allocator.

   If Python is built in debug mode ("configure --with-pydebug
   option"), it also performs some expensive internal consistency
   checks.

   New in version 3.3.

   **CPython implementation detail:** This function is specific to
   CPython.  The exact output format is not defined here, and may
   change.

sys.dllhandle                                    *dllhandle..sys.txt;*

   Integer specifying the handle of the Python DLL.

   Availability: Windows.

sys.displayhook(value)                       *displayhook()..sys.txt;*

   If _value_ is not "None", this function prints "repr(value)" to
   "sys.stdout", and saves _value_ in "builtins._". If "repr(value)"
   is not encodable to "sys.stdout.encoding" with "sys.stdout.errors"
   error handler (which is probably "'strict'"), encode it to
   "sys.stdout.encoding" with "'backslashreplace'" error handler.

   "sys.displayhook" is called on the result of evaluating an
   _expression_ entered in an interactive Python session.  The display
   of these values can be customized by assigning another one-argument
   function to "sys.displayhook".

   Pseudo-code:
>
      def displayhook(value):
          if value is None:
              return
          # Set '_' to None to avoid recursion
          builtins._ = None
          text = repr(value)
          try:
              sys.stdout.write(text)
          except UnicodeEncodeError:
              bytes = text.encode(sys.stdout.encoding, 'backslashreplace')
              if hasattr(sys.stdout, 'buffer'):
                  sys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes)
              else:
                  text = bytes.decode(sys.stdout.encoding, 'strict')
                  sys.stdout.write(text)
          sys.stdout.write("\n")
          builtins._ = value
<
   Changed in version 3.2: Use "'backslashreplace'" error handler on
   "UnicodeEncodeError".

sys.dont_write_bytecode                *dont_write_bytecode..sys.txt;*

   If this is true, Python won’t try to write ".pyc" files on the
   import of source modules.  This value is initially set to "True" or
   "False" depending on the "-B" command line option and the
   "PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE" environment variable, but you can set it
   yourself to control bytecode file generation.

sys._emscripten_info                      *_emscripten_info..sys.txt;*

   A _named tuple_ holding information about the environment on the
   _wasm32-emscripten_ platform. The named tuple is provisional and
   may change in the future.

                       *_emscripten_info.emscripten_version..sys.txt;*
   _emscripten_info.emscripten_version

      Emscripten version as tuple of ints (major, minor, micro), e.g.
      "(3, 1, 8)".

   _emscripten_info.runtime          *_emscripten_info.runtime..sys.txt;*

      Runtime string, e.g. browser user agent, "'Node.js v14.18.2'",
      or "'UNKNOWN'".

   _emscripten_info.pthreads        *_emscripten_info.pthreads..sys.txt;*

      "True" if Python is compiled with Emscripten pthreads support.

                            *_emscripten_info.shared_memory..sys.txt;*
   _emscripten_info.shared_memory

      "True" if Python is compiled with shared memory support.

   Availability: Emscripten.

   New in version 3.11.

sys.pycache_prefix                          *pycache_prefix..sys.txt;*

   If this is set (not "None"), Python will write bytecode-cache
   ".pyc" files to (and read them from) a parallel directory tree
   rooted at this directory, rather than from "__pycache__"
   directories in the source code tree. Any "__pycache__" directories
   in the source code tree will be ignored and new ".pyc" files
   written within the pycache prefix. Thus if you use "compileall" as
   a pre-build step, you must ensure you run it with the same pycache
   prefix (if any) that you will use at runtime.

   A relative path is interpreted relative to the current working
   directory.

   This value is initially set based on the value of the "-X"
   "pycache_prefix=PATH" command-line option or the
   "PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX" environment variable (command-line takes
   precedence). If neither are set, it is "None".

   New in version 3.8.

sys.excepthook(type, value, traceback)        *excepthook()..sys.txt;*

   This function prints out a given traceback and exception to
   "sys.stderr".

   When an exception other than "SystemExit" is raised and uncaught,
   the interpreter calls "sys.excepthook" with three arguments, the
   exception class, exception instance, and a traceback object.  In an
   interactive session this happens just before control is returned to
   the prompt; in a Python program this happens just before the
   program exits.  The handling of such top-level exceptions can be
   customized by assigning another three-argument function to
   "sys.excepthook".

   Raise an auditing event "sys.excepthook" with arguments "hook",
   "type", "value", "traceback" when an uncaught exception occurs. If
   no hook has been set, "hook" may be "None". If any hook raises an
   exception derived from "RuntimeError" the call to the hook will be
   suppressed. Otherwise, the audit hook exception will be reported as
   unraisable and "sys.excepthook" will be called.

   See also:

     The "sys.unraisablehook()" function handles unraisable exceptions
     and the "threading.excepthook()" function handles exception
     raised by "threading.Thread.run()".

sys.__breakpointhook__                  *__breakpointhook__..sys.txt;*
sys.__displayhook__                        *__displayhook__..sys.txt;*
sys.__excepthook__                          *__excepthook__..sys.txt;*
sys.__unraisablehook__                  *__unraisablehook__..sys.txt;*

   These objects contain the original values of "breakpointhook",
   "displayhook", "excepthook", and "unraisablehook" at the start of
   the program.  They are saved so that "breakpointhook",
   "displayhook" and "excepthook", "unraisablehook" can be restored in
   case they happen to get replaced with broken or alternative
   objects.

   New in version 3.7: __breakpointhook__

   New in version 3.8: __unraisablehook__

sys.exception()                                *exception()..sys.txt;*

   This function, when called while an exception handler is executing
   (such as an "except" or "except*" clause), returns the exception
   instance that was caught by this handler. When exception handlers
   are nested within one another, only the exception handled by the
   innermost handler is accessible.

   If no exception handler is executing, this function returns "None".

   New in version 3.11.

sys.exc_info()                                  *exc_info()..sys.txt;*

   This function returns the old-style representation of the handled
   exception. If an exception "e" is currently handled (so
   "exception()" would return "e"), "exc_info()" returns the tuple
   "(type(e), e, e.__traceback__)". That is, a tuple containing the
   type of the exception (a subclass of "BaseException"), the
   exception itself, and a traceback object which typically
   encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception last
   occurred.

   If no exception is being handled anywhere on the stack, this
   function return a tuple containing three "None" values.

   Changed in version 3.11: The "type" and "traceback" fields are now
   derived from the "value" (the exception instance), so when an
   exception is modified while it is being handled, the changes are
   reflected in the results of subsequent calls to "exc_info()".

sys.exec_prefix                                *exec_prefix..sys.txt;*

   A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the
   platform-dependent Python files are installed; by default, this is
   also "'/usr/local'".  This can be set at build time with the "--
   exec-prefix" argument to the **configure** script.  Specifically,
   all configuration files (e.g. the "pyconfig.h" header file) are
   installed in the directory "_exec_prefix_/lib/python_X.Y_/config",
   and shared library modules are installed in
   "_exec_prefix_/lib/python_X.Y_/lib-dynload", where _X.Y_ is the
   version number of Python, for example "3.2".

   Note:

     If a virtual environment is in effect, this value will be changed
     in "site.py" to point to the virtual environment. The value for
     the Python installation will still be available, via
     "base_exec_prefix".

sys.executable                                  *executable..sys.txt;*

   A string giving the absolute path of the executable binary for the
   Python interpreter, on systems where this makes sense. If Python is
   unable to retrieve the real path to its executable,
   "sys.executable" will be an empty string or "None".

sys.exit([arg])                                     *exit()..sys.txt;*

   Raise a "SystemExit" exception, signaling an intention to exit the
   interpreter.

   The optional argument _arg_ can be an integer giving the exit
   status (defaulting to zero), or another type of object.  If it is
   an integer, zero is considered “successful termination” and any
   nonzero value is considered “abnormal termination” by shells and
   the like.  Most systems require it to be in the range 0–127, and
   produce undefined results otherwise.  Some systems have a
   convention for assigning specific meanings to specific exit codes,
   but these are generally underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use
   2 for command line syntax errors and 1 for all other kind of
   errors.  If another type of object is passed, "None" is equivalent
   to passing zero, and any other object is printed to "stderr" and
   results in an exit code of 1.  In particular, "sys.exit("some error
   message")" is a quick way to exit a program when an error occurs.

   Since "exit()" ultimately “only” raises an exception, it will only
   exit the process when called from the main thread, and the
   exception is not intercepted. Cleanup actions specified by finally
   clauses of "try" statements are honored, and it is possible to
   intercept the exit attempt at an outer level.

   Changed in version 3.6: If an error occurs in the cleanup after the
   Python interpreter has caught "SystemExit" (such as an error
   flushing buffered data in the standard streams), the exit status is
   changed to 120.

sys.flags                                            *flags..sys.txt;*

   The _named tuple_ _flags_ exposes the status of command line flags.
   The attributes are read only.

sys.float_info                                  *float_info..sys.txt;*

   A _named tuple_ holding information about the float type. It
   contains low level information about the precision and internal
   representation.  The values correspond to the various floating-
   point constants defined in the standard header file "float.h" for
   the ‘C’ programming language; see section 5.2.4.2.2 of the 1999
   ISO/IEC C standard [C99], ‘Characteristics of floating types’, for
   details.

   +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

   The attribute "sys.float_info.dig" needs further explanation.  If
   "s" is any string representing a decimal number with at most
   "sys.float_info.dig" significant digits, then converting "s" to a
   float and back again will recover a string representing the same
   decimal value:
>
      >>> import sys
      >>> sys.float_info.dig
      15
      >>> s = '3.14159265358979'    # decimal string with 15 significant digits
      >>> format(float(s), '.15g')  # convert to float and back -> same value
      '3.14159265358979'
<
   But for strings with more than "sys.float_info.dig" significant
   digits, this isn’t always true:
>
      >>> s = '9876543211234567'    # 16 significant digits is too many!
      >>> format(float(s), '.16g')  # conversion changes value
      '9876543211234568'
<
sys.float_repr_style                      *float_repr_style..sys.txt;*

   A string indicating how the "repr()" function behaves for floats.
   If the string has value "'short'" then for a finite float "x",
   "repr(x)" aims to produce a short string with the property that
   "float(repr(x)) == x".  This is the usual behaviour in Python 3.1
   and later.  Otherwise, "float_repr_style" has value "'legacy'" and
   "repr(x)" behaves in the same way as it did in versions of Python
   prior to 3.1.

   New in version 3.1.

sys.getallocatedblocks()              *getallocatedblocks()..sys.txt;*

   Return the number of memory blocks currently allocated by the
   interpreter, regardless of their size.  This function is mainly
   useful for tracking and debugging memory leaks.  Because of the
   interpreter’s internal caches, the result can vary from call to
   call; you may have to call "_clear_type_cache()" and "gc.collect()"
   to get more predictable results.

   If a Python build or implementation cannot reasonably compute this
   information, "getallocatedblocks()" is allowed to return 0 instead.

   New in version 3.4.

sys.getunicodeinternedsize()      *getunicodeinternedsize()..sys.txt;*

   Return the number of unicode objects that have been interned.

   New in version 3.12.

sys.getandroidapilevel()              *getandroidapilevel()..sys.txt;*

   Return the build time API version of Android as an integer.

   Availability: Android.

   New in version 3.7.

sys.getdefaultencoding()              *getdefaultencoding()..sys.txt;*

   Return the name of the current default string encoding used by the
   Unicode implementation.

sys.getdlopenflags()                      *getdlopenflags()..sys.txt;*

   Return the current value of the flags that are used for "dlopen()"
   calls.  Symbolic names for the flag values can be found in the "os"
   module ("RTLD_xxx" constants, e.g. "os.RTLD_LAZY").

   Availability: Unix.

sys.getfilesystemencoding()        *getfilesystemencoding()..sys.txt;*

   Get the _filesystem encoding_: the encoding used with the
   _filesystem error handler_ to convert between Unicode filenames and
   bytes filenames. The filesystem error handler is returned from
   "getfilesystemencodeerrors()".

   For best compatibility, str should be used for filenames in all
   cases, although representing filenames as bytes is also supported.
   Functions accepting or returning filenames should support either
   str or bytes and internally convert to the system’s preferred
   representation.

   "os.fsencode()" and "os.fsdecode()" should be used to ensure that
   the correct encoding and errors mode are used.

   The _filesystem encoding and error handler_ are configured at
   Python startup by the "PyConfig_Read()" function: see
   "filesystem_encoding" and "filesystem_errors" members of
   "PyConfig".

   Changed in version 3.2: "getfilesystemencoding()" result cannot be
   "None" anymore.

   Changed in version 3.6: Windows is no longer guaranteed to return
   "'mbcs'". See **PEP 529** and "_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()"
   for more information.

   Changed in version 3.7: Return "'utf-8'" if the Python UTF-8 Mode
   is enabled.

                               *getfilesystemencodeerrors()..sys.txt;*
sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors()

   Get the _filesystem error handler_: the error handler used with the
   _filesystem encoding_ to convert between Unicode filenames and
   bytes filenames. The filesystem encoding is returned from
   "getfilesystemencoding()".

   "os.fsencode()" and "os.fsdecode()" should be used to ensure that
   the correct encoding and errors mode are used.

   The _filesystem encoding and error handler_ are configured at
   Python startup by the "PyConfig_Read()" function: see
   "filesystem_encoding" and "filesystem_errors" members of
   "PyConfig".

   New in version 3.6.

sys.get_int_max_str_digits()      *get_int_max_str_digits()..sys.txt;*

   Returns the current value for the integer string conversion length
   limitation. See also "set_int_max_str_digits()".

   New in version 3.11.

sys.getrefcount(object)                      *getrefcount()..sys.txt;*

   Return the reference count of the _object_.  The count returned is
   generally one higher than you might expect, because it includes the
   (temporary) reference as an argument to "getrefcount()".

   Note that the returned value may not actually reflect how many
   references to the object are actually held.  For example, some
   objects are “immortal” and have a very high refcount that does not
   reflect the actual number of references.  Consequently, do not rely
   on the returned value to be accurate, other than a value of 0 or 1.

   Changed in version 3.12: Immortal objects have very large refcounts
   that do not match the actual number of references to the object.

sys.getrecursionlimit()                *getrecursionlimit()..sys.txt;*

   Return the current value of the recursion limit, the maximum depth
   of the Python interpreter stack.  This limit prevents infinite
   recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing
   Python.  It can be set by "setrecursionlimit()".

sys.getsizeof(object[, default])               *getsizeof()..sys.txt;*

   Return the size of an object in bytes. The object can be any type
   of object. All built-in objects will return correct results, but
   this does not have to hold true for third-party extensions as it is
   implementation specific.

   Only the memory consumption directly attributed to the object is
   accounted for, not the memory consumption of objects it refers to.

   If given, _default_ will be returned if the object does not provide
   means to retrieve the size.  Otherwise a "TypeError" will be
   raised.

   "getsizeof()" calls the object’s "__sizeof__" method and adds an
   additional garbage collector overhead if the object is managed by
   the garbage collector.

   See recursive sizeof recipe for an example of using "getsizeof()"
   recursively to find the size of containers and all their contents.

sys.getswitchinterval()                *getswitchinterval()..sys.txt;*

   Return the interpreter’s “thread switch interval”; see
   "setswitchinterval()".

   New in version 3.2.

sys._getframe([depth])                         *_getframe()..sys.txt;*

   Return a frame object from the call stack.  If optional integer
   _depth_ is given, return the frame object that many calls below the
   top of the stack.  If that is deeper than the call stack,
   "ValueError" is raised.  The default for _depth_ is zero, returning
   the frame at the top of the call stack.

   Raises an auditing event "sys._getframe" with argument "frame".

   **CPython implementation detail:** This function should be used for
   internal and specialized purposes only. It is not guaranteed to
   exist in all implementations of Python.

sys._getframemodulename([depth])     *_getframemodulename()..sys.txt;*

   Return the name of a module from the call stack.  If optional
   integer _depth_ is given, return the module that many calls below
   the top of the stack.  If that is deeper than the call stack, or if
   the module is unidentifiable, "None" is returned.  The default for
   _depth_ is zero, returning the module at the top of the call stack.

   Raises an auditing event "sys._getframemodulename" with argument
   "depth".

   **CPython implementation detail:** This function should be used for
   internal and specialized purposes only. It is not guaranteed to
   exist in all implementations of Python.

sys.getprofile()                              *getprofile()..sys.txt;*

   Get the profiler function as set by "setprofile()".

sys.gettrace()                                  *gettrace()..sys.txt;*

   Get the trace function as set by "settrace()".

   **CPython implementation detail:** The "gettrace()" function is
   intended only for implementing debuggers, profilers, coverage tools
   and the like.  Its behavior is part of the implementation platform,
   rather than part of the language definition, and thus may not be
   available in all Python implementations.

sys.getwindowsversion()                *getwindowsversion()..sys.txt;*

   Return a named tuple describing the Windows version currently
   running.  The named elements are _major_, _minor_, _build_,
   _platform_, _service_pack_, _service_pack_minor_,
   _service_pack_major_, _suite_mask_, _product_type_ and
   _platform_version_. _service_pack_ contains a string,
   _platform_version_ a 3-tuple and all other values are integers. The
   components can also be accessed by name, so
   "sys.getwindowsversion()[0]" is equivalent to
   "sys.getwindowsversion().major". For compatibility with prior
   versions, only the first 5 elements are retrievable by indexing.

   _platform_ will be "2" (VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT).

   _product_type_ may be one of the following values:

   +-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | Constant                                | Meaning                           |
   |=========================================|===================================|
   | "1" (VER_NT_WORKSTATION)                | The system is a workstation.      |
   +-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | "2" (VER_NT_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER)          | The system is a domain            |
   |                                         | controller.                       |
   +-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | "3" (VER_NT_SERVER)                     | The system is a server, but not a |
   |                                         | domain controller.                |
   +-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

   This function wraps the Win32 "GetVersionEx()" function; see the
   Microsoft documentation on "OSVERSIONINFOEX()" for more information
   about these fields.

   _platform_version_ returns the major version, minor version and
   build number of the current operating system, rather than the
   version that is being emulated for the process. It is intended for
   use in logging rather than for feature detection.

   Note:

     _platform_version_ derives the version from kernel32.dll which
     can be of a different version than the OS version. Please use
     "platform" module for achieving accurate OS version.

   Availability: Windows.

   Changed in version 3.2: Changed to a named tuple and added
   _service_pack_minor_, _service_pack_major_, _suite_mask_, and
   _product_type_.

   Changed in version 3.6: Added _platform_version_

sys.get_asyncgen_hooks()              *get_asyncgen_hooks()..sys.txt;*

   Returns an _asyncgen_hooks_ object, which is similar to a
   "namedtuple" of the form "(firstiter, finalizer)", where
   _firstiter_ and _finalizer_ are expected to be either "None" or
   functions which take an _asynchronous generator iterator_ as an
   argument, and are used to schedule finalization of an asynchronous
   generator by an event loop.

   New in version 3.6: See **PEP 525** for more details.

   Note:

     This function has been added on a provisional basis (see **PEP
     411** for details.)

                     *get_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()..sys.txt;*
sys.get_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()

   Get the current coroutine origin tracking depth, as set by
   "set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()".

   New in version 3.7.

   Note:

     This function has been added on a provisional basis (see **PEP
     411** for details.)  Use it only for debugging purposes.

sys.hash_info                                    *hash_info..sys.txt;*

   A _named tuple_ giving parameters of the numeric hash
   implementation.  For more details about hashing of numeric types,
   see Hashing of numeric types.

   hash_info.width                            *hash_info.width..sys.txt;*

      The width in bits used for hash values

   hash_info.modulus                        *hash_info.modulus..sys.txt;*

      The prime modulus P used for numeric hash scheme

   hash_info.inf                                *hash_info.inf..sys.txt;*

      The hash value returned for a positive infinity

   hash_info.nan                                *hash_info.nan..sys.txt;*

      (This attribute is no longer used)

   hash_info.imag                              *hash_info.imag..sys.txt;*

      The multiplier used for the imaginary part of a complex number

   hash_info.algorithm                    *hash_info.algorithm..sys.txt;*

      The name of the algorithm for hashing of str, bytes, and
      memoryview

   hash_info.hash_bits                    *hash_info.hash_bits..sys.txt;*

      The internal output size of the hash algorithm

   hash_info.seed_bits                    *hash_info.seed_bits..sys.txt;*

      The size of the seed key of the hash algorithm

   New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.4: Added _algorithm_, _hash_bits_ and
   _seed_bits_

sys.hexversion                                  *hexversion..sys.txt;*

   The version number encoded as a single integer.  This is guaranteed
   to increase with each version, including proper support for non-
   production releases.  For example, to test that the Python
   interpreter is at least version 1.5.2, use:
>
      if sys.hexversion >= 0x010502F0:
          # use some advanced feature
          ...
      else:
          # use an alternative implementation or warn the user
          ...
<
   This is called "hexversion" since it only really looks meaningful
   when viewed as the result of passing it to the built-in "hex()"
   function.  The _named tuple_  "sys.version_info" may be used for a
   more human-friendly encoding of the same information.

   More details of "hexversion" can be found at API and ABI
   Versioning.

sys.implementation                          *implementation..sys.txt;*

   An object containing information about the implementation of the
   currently running Python interpreter.  The following attributes are
   required to exist in all Python implementations.

   _name_ is the implementation’s identifier, e.g. "'cpython'".  The
   actual string is defined by the Python implementation, but it is
   guaranteed to be lower case.

   _version_ is a named tuple, in the same format as
   "sys.version_info".  It represents the version of the Python
   _implementation_.  This has a distinct meaning from the specific
   version of the Python _language_ to which the currently running
   interpreter conforms, which "sys.version_info" represents.  For
   example, for PyPy 1.8 "sys.implementation.version" might be
   "sys.version_info(1, 8, 0, 'final', 0)", whereas "sys.version_info"
   would be "sys.version_info(2, 7, 2, 'final', 0)".  For CPython they
   are the same value, since it is the reference implementation.

   _hexversion_ is the implementation version in hexadecimal format,
   like "sys.hexversion".

   _cache_tag_ is the tag used by the import machinery in the
   filenames of cached modules.  By convention, it would be a
   composite of the implementation’s name and version, like
   "'cpython-33'".  However, a Python implementation may use some
   other value if appropriate.  If "cache_tag" is set to "None", it
   indicates that module caching should be disabled.

   "sys.implementation" may contain additional attributes specific to
   the Python implementation.  These non-standard attributes must
   start with an underscore, and are not described here.  Regardless
   of its contents, "sys.implementation" will not change during a run
   of the interpreter, nor between implementation versions.  (It may
   change between Python language versions, however.)  See **PEP 421**
   for more information.

   New in version 3.3.

   Note:

     The addition of new required attributes must go through the
     normal PEP process. See **PEP 421** for more information.

sys.int_info                                      *int_info..sys.txt;*

   A _named tuple_ that holds information about Python’s internal
   representation of integers.  The attributes are read only.

   int_info.bits_per_digit            *int_info.bits_per_digit..sys.txt;*

      The number of bits held in each digit. Python integers are
      stored internally in base "2**int_info.bits_per_digit".

   int_info.sizeof_digit                *int_info.sizeof_digit..sys.txt;*

      The size in bytes of the C type used to represent a digit.

                           *int_info.default_max_str_digits..sys.txt;*
   int_info.default_max_str_digits

      The default value for "sys.get_int_max_str_digits()" when it is
      not otherwise explicitly configured.

                       *int_info.str_digits_check_threshold..sys.txt;*
   int_info.str_digits_check_threshold

      The minimum non-zero value for "sys.set_int_max_str_digits()",
      "PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS", or "-X int_max_str_digits".

   New in version 3.1.

   Changed in version 3.11: Added "default_max_str_digits" and
   "str_digits_check_threshold".

sys.__interactivehook__                *__interactivehook__..sys.txt;*

   When this attribute exists, its value is automatically called (with
   no arguments) when the interpreter is launched in interactive mode.
   This is done after the "PYTHONSTARTUP" file is read, so that you
   can set this hook there.  The "site" module sets this.

   Raises an auditing event "cpython.run_interactivehook" with the
   hook object as the argument when the hook is called on startup.

   New in version 3.4.

sys.intern(string)                                *intern()..sys.txt;*

   Enter _string_ in the table of “interned” strings and return the
   interned string – which is _string_ itself or a copy. Interning
   strings is useful to gain a little performance on dictionary lookup
   – if the keys in a dictionary are interned, and the lookup key is
   interned, the key comparisons (after hashing) can be done by a
   pointer compare instead of a string compare.  Normally, the names
   used in Python programs are automatically interned, and the
   dictionaries used to hold module, class or instance attributes have
   interned keys.

   Interned strings are not immortal; you must keep a reference to the
   return value of "intern()" around to benefit from it.

sys.is_finalizing()                        *is_finalizing()..sys.txt;*

   Return "True" if the main Python interpreter is _shutting down_.
   Return "False" otherwise.

   New in version 3.5.

sys.last_exc                                      *last_exc..sys.txt;*

   This variable is not always defined; it is set to the exception
   instance when an exception is not handled and the interpreter
   prints an error message and a stack traceback.  Its intended use is
   to allow an interactive user to import a debugger module and engage
   in post-mortem debugging without having to re-execute the command
   that caused the error.  (Typical use is "import pdb; pdb.pm()" to
   enter the post-mortem debugger; see "pdb" module for more
   information.)

   New in version 3.12.

sys.last_type                                    *last_type..sys.txt;*
sys.last_value                                  *last_value..sys.txt;*
sys.last_traceback                          *last_traceback..sys.txt;*

   These three variables are deprecated; use "sys.last_exc" instead.
   They hold the legacy representation of "sys.last_exc", as returned
   from "exc_info()" above.

sys.maxsize                                        *maxsize..sys.txt;*

   An integer giving the maximum value a variable of type "Py_ssize_t"
   can take.  It’s usually "2**31 - 1" on a 32-bit platform and "2**63
   - 1" on a 64-bit platform.

sys.maxunicode                                  *maxunicode..sys.txt;*

   An integer giving the value of the largest Unicode code point, i.e.
   "1114111" ("0x10FFFF" in hexadecimal).

   Changed in version 3.3: Before **PEP 393**, "sys.maxunicode" used
   to be either "0xFFFF" or "0x10FFFF", depending on the configuration
   option that specified whether Unicode characters were stored as
   UCS-2 or UCS-4.

sys.meta_path                                    *meta_path..sys.txt;*

   A list of _meta path finder_ objects that have their "find_spec()"
   methods called to see if one of the objects can find the module to
   be imported. By default, it holds entries that implement Python’s
   default import semantics. The "find_spec()" method is called with
   at least the absolute name of the module being imported. If the
   module to be imported is contained in a package, then the parent
   package’s "__path__" attribute is passed in as a second argument.
   The method returns a _module spec_, or "None" if the module cannot
   be found.

   See also:

     "importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder"
        The abstract base class defining the interface of finder
        objects on "meta_path".

     "importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec"
        The concrete class which "find_spec()" should return instances
        of.

   Changed in version 3.4: _Module specs_ were introduced in Python
   3.4, by **PEP 451**. Earlier versions of Python looked for a method
   called "find_module()". This is still called as a fallback if a
   "meta_path" entry doesn’t have a "find_spec()" method.

sys.modules                                        *modules..sys.txt;*

   This is a dictionary that maps module names to modules which have
   already been loaded.  This can be manipulated to force reloading of
   modules and other tricks. However, replacing the dictionary will
   not necessarily work as expected and deleting essential items from
   the dictionary may cause Python to fail.  If you want to iterate
   over this global dictionary always use "sys.modules.copy()" or
   "tuple(sys.modules)" to avoid exceptions as its size may change
   during iteration as a side effect of code or activity in other
   threads.

sys.orig_argv                                    *orig_argv..sys.txt;*

   The list of the original command line arguments passed to the
   Python executable.

   See also "sys.argv".

   New in version 3.10.

sys.path                                              *path..sys.txt;*

   A list of strings that specifies the search path for modules.
   Initialized from the environment variable "PYTHONPATH", plus an
   installation-dependent default.

   By default, as initialized upon program startup, a potentially
   unsafe path is prepended to "sys.path" (_before_ the entries
   inserted as a result of "PYTHONPATH"):

   * "python -m module" command line: prepend the current working
     directory.

   * "python script.py" command line: prepend the script’s directory.
     If it’s a symbolic link, resolve symbolic links.

   * "python -c code" and "python" (REPL) command lines: prepend an
     empty string, which means the current working directory.

   To not prepend this potentially unsafe path, use the "-P" command
   line option or the "PYTHONSAFEPATH" environment variable.

   A program is free to modify this list for its own purposes.  Only
   strings should be added to "sys.path"; all other data types are
   ignored during import.

   See also:

     * Module "site" This describes how to use .pth files to extend
       "sys.path".

sys.path_hooks                                  *path_hooks..sys.txt;*

   A list of callables that take a path argument to try to create a
   _finder_ for the path. If a finder can be created, it is to be
   returned by the callable, else raise "ImportError".

   Originally specified in **PEP 302**.

sys.path_importer_cache                *path_importer_cache..sys.txt;*

   A dictionary acting as a cache for _finder_ objects. The keys are
   paths that have been passed to "sys.path_hooks" and the values are
   the finders that are found. If a path is a valid file system path
   but no finder is found on "sys.path_hooks" then "None" is stored.

   Originally specified in **PEP 302**.

sys.platform                                      *platform..sys.txt;*

   This string contains a platform identifier that can be used to
   append platform-specific components to "sys.path", for instance.

   For Unix systems, except on Linux and AIX, this is the lowercased
   OS name as returned by "uname -s" with the first part of the
   version as returned by "uname -r" appended, e.g. "'sunos5'" or
   "'freebsd8'", _at the time when Python was built_.  Unless you want
   to test for a specific system version, it is therefore recommended
   to use the following idiom:
>
      if sys.platform.startswith('freebsd'):
          # FreeBSD-specific code here...
      elif sys.platform.startswith('linux'):
          # Linux-specific code here...
      elif sys.platform.startswith('aix'):
          # AIX-specific code here...
<
   For other systems, the values are:

   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | System           | "platform" value            |
   |==================|=============================|
   | AIX              | "'aix'"                     |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Emscripten       | "'emscripten'"              |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Linux            | "'linux'"                   |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | WASI             | "'wasi'"                    |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Windows          | "'win32'"                   |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Windows/Cygwin   | "'cygwin'"                  |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+
   | macOS            | "'darwin'"                  |
   +------------------+-----------------------------+

   Changed in version 3.3: On Linux, "sys.platform" doesn’t contain
   the major version anymore. It is always "'linux'", instead of
   "'linux2'" or "'linux3'".  Since older Python versions include the
   version number, it is recommended to always use the "startswith"
   idiom presented above.

   Changed in version 3.8: On AIX, "sys.platform" doesn’t contain the
   major version anymore. It is always "'aix'", instead of "'aix5'" or
   "'aix7'".  Since older Python versions include the version number,
   it is recommended to always use the "startswith" idiom presented
   above.

   See also:

     "os.name" has a coarser granularity.  "os.uname()" gives system-
     dependent version information.

     The "platform" module provides detailed checks for the system’s
     identity.

sys.platlibdir                                  *platlibdir..sys.txt;*

   Name of the platform-specific library directory. It is used to
   build the path of standard library and the paths of installed
   extension modules.

   It is equal to ""lib"" on most platforms. On Fedora and SuSE, it is
   equal to ""lib64"" on 64-bit platforms which gives the following
   "sys.path" paths (where "X.Y" is the Python "major.minor" version):

   * "/usr/lib64/pythonX.Y/": Standard library (like "os.py" of the
     "os" module)

   * "/usr/lib64/pythonX.Y/lib-dynload/": C extension modules of the
     standard library (like the "errno" module, the exact filename is
     platform specific)

   * "/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/" (always use "lib", not
     "sys.platlibdir"): Third-party modules

   * "/usr/lib64/pythonX.Y/site-packages/": C extension modules of
     third-party packages

   New in version 3.9.

sys.prefix                                          *prefix..sys.txt;*

   A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the
   platform independent Python files are installed; on Unix, the
   default is "/usr/local". This can be set at build time with the "--
   prefix" argument to the **configure** script.  See Installation
   paths for derived paths.

   Note:

     If a virtual environment is in effect, this value will be changed
     in "site.py" to point to the virtual environment. The value for
     the Python installation will still be available, via
     "base_prefix".

sys.ps1                                                *ps1..sys.txt;*
sys.ps2                                                *ps2..sys.txt;*

   Strings specifying the primary and secondary prompt of the
   interpreter.  These are only defined if the interpreter is in
   interactive mode.  Their initial values in this case are "'>>> '"
   and "'... '".  If a non-string object is assigned to either
   variable, its "str()" is re-evaluated each time the interpreter
   prepares to read a new interactive command; this can be used to
   implement a dynamic prompt.

sys.setdlopenflags(n)                     *setdlopenflags()..sys.txt;*

   Set the flags used by the interpreter for "dlopen()" calls, such as
   when the interpreter loads extension modules.  Among other things,
   this will enable a lazy resolving of symbols when importing a
   module, if called as "sys.setdlopenflags(0)".  To share symbols
   across extension modules, call as
   "sys.setdlopenflags(os.RTLD_GLOBAL)".  Symbolic names for the flag
   values can be found in the "os" module ("RTLD_xxx" constants, e.g.
   "os.RTLD_LAZY").

   Availability: Unix.

                                  *set_int_max_str_digits()..sys.txt;*
sys.set_int_max_str_digits(maxdigits)

   Set the integer string conversion length limitation used by this
   interpreter. See also "get_int_max_str_digits()".

   New in version 3.11.

sys.setprofile(profilefunc)                   *setprofile()..sys.txt;*

   Set the system’s profile function, which allows you to implement a
   Python source code profiler in Python.  See chapter The Python
   Profilers for more information on the Python profiler.  The
   system’s profile function is called similarly to the system’s trace
   function (see "settrace()"), but it is called with different
   events, for example it isn’t called for each executed line of code
   (only on call and return, but the return event is reported even
   when an exception has been set). The function is thread-specific,
   but there is no way for the profiler to know about context switches
   between threads, so it does not make sense to use this in the
   presence of multiple threads. Also, its return value is not used,
   so it can simply return "None".  Error in the profile function will
   cause itself unset.

   Profile functions should have three arguments: _frame_, _event_,
   and _arg_. _frame_ is the current stack frame.  _event_ is a
   string: "'call'", "'return'", "'c_call'", "'c_return'", or
   "'c_exception'". _arg_ depends on the event type.

   Raises an auditing event "sys.setprofile" with no arguments.

   The events have the following meaning:

   "'call'"
      A function is called (or some other code block entered).  The
      profile function is called; _arg_ is "None".

   "'return'"
      A function (or other code block) is about to return.  The
      profile function is called; _arg_ is the value that will be
      returned, or "None" if the event is caused by an exception being
      raised.

   "'c_call'"
      A C function is about to be called.  This may be an extension
      function or a built-in.  _arg_ is the C function object.

   "'c_return'"
      A C function has returned. _arg_ is the C function object.

   "'c_exception'"
      A C function has raised an exception.  _arg_ is the C function
      object.

sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)           *setrecursionlimit()..sys.txt;*

   Set the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to _limit_.
   This limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of
   the C stack and crashing Python.

   The highest possible limit is platform-dependent.  A user may need
   to set the limit higher when they have a program that requires deep
   recursion and a platform that supports a higher limit.  This should
   be done with care, because a too-high limit can lead to a crash.

   If the new limit is too low at the current recursion depth, a
   "RecursionError" exception is raised.

   Changed in version 3.5.1: A "RecursionError" exception is now
   raised if the new limit is too low at the current recursion depth.

sys.setswitchinterval(interval)        *setswitchinterval()..sys.txt;*

   Set the interpreter’s thread switch interval (in seconds).  This
   floating-point value determines the ideal duration of the
   “timeslices” allocated to concurrently running Python threads.
   Please note that the actual value can be higher, especially if
   long-running internal functions or methods are used.  Also, which
   thread becomes scheduled at the end of the interval is the
   operating system’s decision.  The interpreter doesn’t have its own
   scheduler.

   New in version 3.2.

sys.settrace(tracefunc)                         *settrace()..sys.txt;*

   Set the system’s trace function, which allows you to implement a
   Python source code debugger in Python.  The function is thread-
   specific; for a debugger to support multiple threads, it must
   register a trace function using "settrace()" for each thread being
   debugged or use "threading.settrace()".

   Trace functions should have three arguments: _frame_, _event_, and
   _arg_. _frame_ is the current stack frame.  _event_ is a string:
   "'call'", "'line'", "'return'", "'exception'" or "'opcode'".  _arg_
   depends on the event type.

   The trace function is invoked (with _event_ set to "'call'")
   whenever a new local scope is entered; it should return a reference
   to a local trace function to be used for the new scope, or "None"
   if the scope shouldn’t be traced.

   The local trace function should return a reference to itself (or to
   another function for further tracing in that scope), or "None" to
   turn off tracing in that scope.

   If there is any error occurred in the trace function, it will be
   unset, just like "settrace(None)" is called.

   The events have the following meaning:

   "'call'"
      A function is called (or some other code block entered).  The
      global trace function is called; _arg_ is "None"; the return
      value specifies the local trace function.

   "'line'"
      The interpreter is about to execute a new line of code or re-
      execute the condition of a loop.  The local trace function is
      called; _arg_ is "None"; the return value specifies the new
      local trace function.  See "Objects/lnotab_notes.txt" for a
      detailed explanation of how this works. Per-line events may be
      disabled for a frame by setting "f_trace_lines" to "False" on
      that frame.

   "'return'"
      A function (or other code block) is about to return.  The local
      trace function is called; _arg_ is the value that will be
      returned, or "None" if the event is caused by an exception being
      raised.  The trace function’s return value is ignored.

   "'exception'"
      An exception has occurred.  The local trace function is called;
      _arg_ is a tuple "(exception, value, traceback)"; the return
      value specifies the new local trace function.

   "'opcode'"
      The interpreter is about to execute a new opcode (see "dis" for
      opcode details).  The local trace function is called; _arg_ is
      "None"; the return value specifies the new local trace function.
      Per-opcode events are not emitted by default: they must be
      explicitly requested by setting "f_trace_opcodes" to "True" on
      the frame.

   Note that as an exception is propagated down the chain of callers,
   an "'exception'" event is generated at each level.

   For more fine-grained usage, it’s possible to set a trace function
   by assigning "frame.f_trace = tracefunc" explicitly, rather than
   relying on it being set indirectly via the return value from an
   already installed trace function. This is also required for
   activating the trace function on the current frame, which
   "settrace()" doesn’t do. Note that in order for this to work, a
   global tracing function must have been installed with "settrace()"
   in order to enable the runtime tracing machinery, but it doesn’t
   need to be the same tracing function (e.g. it could be a low
   overhead tracing function that simply returns "None" to disable
   itself immediately on each frame).

   For more information on code and frame objects, refer to The
   standard type hierarchy.

   Raises an auditing event "sys.settrace" with no arguments.

   **CPython implementation detail:** The "settrace()" function is
   intended only for implementing debuggers, profilers, coverage tools
   and the like.  Its behavior is part of the implementation platform,
   rather than part of the language definition, and thus may not be
   available in all Python implementations.

   Changed in version 3.7: "'opcode'" event type added;
   "f_trace_lines" and "f_trace_opcodes" attributes added to frames

                                      *set_asyncgen_hooks()..sys.txt;*
sys.set_asyncgen_hooks(firstiter, finalizer)

   Accepts two optional keyword arguments which are callables that
   accept an _asynchronous generator iterator_ as an argument. The
   _firstiter_ callable will be called when an asynchronous generator
   is iterated for the first time. The _finalizer_ will be called when
   an asynchronous generator is about to be garbage collected.

   Raises an auditing event "sys.set_asyncgen_hooks_firstiter" with no
   arguments.

   Raises an auditing event "sys.set_asyncgen_hooks_finalizer" with no
   arguments.

   Two auditing events are raised because the underlying API consists
   of two calls, each of which must raise its own event.

   New in version 3.6: See **PEP 525** for more details, and for a
   reference example of a _finalizer_ method see the implementation of
   "asyncio.Loop.shutdown_asyncgens" in Lib/asyncio/base_events.py

   Note:

     This function has been added on a provisional basis (see **PEP
     411** for details.)

                     *set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()..sys.txt;*
sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth(depth)

   Allows enabling or disabling coroutine origin tracking. When
   enabled, the "cr_origin" attribute on coroutine objects will
   contain a tuple of (filename, line number, function name) tuples
   describing the traceback where the coroutine object was created,
   with the most recent call first. When disabled, "cr_origin" will be
   None.

   To enable, pass a _depth_ value greater than zero; this sets the
   number of frames whose information will be captured. To disable,
   pass set _depth_ to zero.

   This setting is thread-specific.

   New in version 3.7.

   Note:

     This function has been added on a provisional basis (see **PEP
     411** for details.)  Use it only for debugging purposes.

                               *activate_stack_trampoline()..sys.txt;*
sys.activate_stack_trampoline(backend, /)

   Activate the stack profiler trampoline _backend_. The only
   supported backend is ""perf"".

   Availability: Linux.

   New in version 3.12.

   See also:

     * Python support for the Linux perf profiler

     * https://perf.wiki.kernel.org

                             *deactivate_stack_trampoline()..sys.txt;*
sys.deactivate_stack_trampoline()

   Deactivate the current stack profiler trampoline backend.

   If no stack profiler is activated, this function has no effect.

   Availability: Linux.

   New in version 3.12.

                              *is_stack_trampoline_active()..sys.txt;*
sys.is_stack_trampoline_active()

   Return "True" if a stack profiler trampoline is active.

   Availability: Linux.

   New in version 3.12.

                          *_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()..sys.txt;*
sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()

   Changes the _filesystem encoding and error handler_ to ‘mbcs’ and
   ‘replace’ respectively, for consistency with versions of Python
   prior to 3.6.

   This is equivalent to defining the "PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING"
   environment variable before launching Python.

   See also "sys.getfilesystemencoding()" and
   "sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors()".

   Availability: Windows.

   New in version 3.6: See **PEP 529** for more details.

sys.stdin                                            *stdin..sys.txt;*
sys.stdout                                          *stdout..sys.txt;*
sys.stderr                                          *stderr..sys.txt;*

   _File objects_ used by the interpreter for standard input, output
   and errors:

   * "stdin" is used for all interactive input (including calls to
     "input()");

   * "stdout" is used for the output of "print()" and _expression_
     statements and for the prompts of "input()";

   * The interpreter’s own prompts and its error messages go to
     "stderr".

   These streams are regular _text files_ like those returned by the
   "open()" function.  Their parameters are chosen as follows:

   * The encoding and error handling are is initialized from
     "PyConfig.stdio_encoding" and "PyConfig.stdio_errors".

     On Windows, UTF-8 is used for the console device.  Non-character
     devices such as disk files and pipes use the system locale
     encoding (i.e. the ANSI codepage).  Non-console character devices
     such as NUL (i.e. where "isatty()" returns "True") use the value
     of the console input and output codepages at startup,
     respectively for stdin and stdout/stderr. This defaults to the
     system _locale encoding_ if the process is not initially attached
     to a console.

     The special behaviour of the console can be overridden by setting
     the environment variable PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSSTDIO before starting
     Python. In that case, the console codepages are used as for any
     other character device.

     Under all platforms, you can override the character encoding by
     setting the "PYTHONIOENCODING" environment variable before
     starting Python or by using the new "-X" "utf8" command line
     option and "PYTHONUTF8" environment variable.  However, for the
     Windows console, this only applies when
     "PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSSTDIO" is also set.

   * When interactive, the "stdout" stream is line-buffered.
     Otherwise, it is block-buffered like regular text files.  The
     "stderr" stream is line-buffered in both cases.  You can make
     both streams unbuffered by passing the "-u" command-line option
     or setting the "PYTHONUNBUFFERED" environment variable.

   Changed in version 3.9: Non-interactive "stderr" is now line-
   buffered instead of fully buffered.

   Note:

     To write or read binary data from/to the standard streams, use
     the underlying binary "buffer" object.  For example, to write
     bytes to "stdout", use "sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'abc')".However,
     if you are writing a library (and do not control in which context
     its code will be executed), be aware that the standard streams
     may be replaced with file-like objects like "io.StringIO" which
     do not support the :attr:!buffer` attribute.

sys.__stdin__                                    *__stdin__..sys.txt;*
sys.__stdout__                                  *__stdout__..sys.txt;*
sys.__stderr__                                  *__stderr__..sys.txt;*

   These objects contain the original values of "stdin", "stderr" and
   "stdout" at the start of the program.  They are used during
   finalization, and could be useful to print to the actual standard
   stream no matter if the "sys.std*" object has been redirected.

   It can also be used to restore the actual files to known working
   file objects in case they have been overwritten with a broken
   object.  However, the preferred way to do this is to explicitly
   save the previous stream before replacing it, and restore the saved
   object.

   Note:

     Under some conditions "stdin", "stdout" and "stderr" as well as
     the original values "__stdin__", "__stdout__" and "__stderr__"
     can be "None". It is usually the case for Windows GUI apps that
     aren’t connected to a console and Python apps started with
     **pythonw**.

sys.stdlib_module_names                *stdlib_module_names..sys.txt;*

   A frozenset of strings containing the names of standard library
   modules.

   It is the same on all platforms. Modules which are not available on
   some platforms and modules disabled at Python build are also
   listed. All module kinds are listed: pure Python, built-in, frozen
   and extension modules. Test modules are excluded.

   For packages, only the main package is listed: sub-packages and
   sub-modules are not listed. For example, the "email" package is
   listed, but the "email.mime" sub-package and the "email.message"
   sub-module are not listed.

   See also the "sys.builtin_module_names" list.

   New in version 3.10.

sys.thread_info                                *thread_info..sys.txt;*

   A _named tuple_ holding information about the thread
   implementation.

   thread_info.name                          *thread_info.name..sys.txt;*

      The name of the thread implementation:

      * ""nt"": Windows threads

      * ""pthread"": POSIX threads

      * ""pthread-stubs"": stub POSIX threads (on WebAssembly
        platforms without threading support)

      * ""solaris"": Solaris threads

   thread_info.lock                          *thread_info.lock..sys.txt;*

      The name of the lock implementation:

      * ""semaphore"": a lock uses a semaphore

      * ""mutex+cond"": a lock uses a mutex and a condition variable

      * "None" if this information is unknown

   thread_info.version                    *thread_info.version..sys.txt;*

      The name and version of the thread library. It is a string, or
      "None" if this information is unknown.

   New in version 3.3.

sys.tracebacklimit                          *tracebacklimit..sys.txt;*

   When this variable is set to an integer value, it determines the
   maximum number of levels of traceback information printed when an
   unhandled exception occurs. The default is "1000".  When set to "0"
   or less, all traceback information is suppressed and only the
   exception type and value are printed.

sys.unraisablehook(unraisable, /)         *unraisablehook()..sys.txt;*

   Handle an unraisable exception.

   Called when an exception has occurred but there is no way for
   Python to handle it. For example, when a destructor raises an
   exception or during garbage collection ("gc.collect()").

   The _unraisable_ argument has the following attributes:

   * "exc_type": Exception type.

   * "exc_value": Exception value, can be "None".

   * "exc_traceback": Exception traceback, can be "None".

   * "err_msg": Error message, can be "None".

   * "object": Object causing the exception, can be "None".

   The default hook formats "err_msg" and "object" as: "f'{err_msg}:
   {object!r}'"; use “Exception ignored in” error message if "err_msg"
   is "None".

   "sys.unraisablehook()" can be overridden to control how unraisable
   exceptions are handled.

   See also: "excepthook()" which handles uncaught exceptions.

   Warning:

     Storing "exc_value" using a custom hook can create a reference
     cycle. It should be cleared explicitly to break the reference
     cycle when the exception is no longer needed.Storing "object"
     using a custom hook can resurrect it if it is set to an object
     which is being finalized. Avoid storing "object" after the custom
     hook completes to avoid resurrecting objects.

   Raise an auditing event "sys.unraisablehook" with arguments _hook_,
   _unraisable_ when an exception that cannot be handled occurs. The
   _unraisable_ object is the same as what will be passed to the hook.
   If no hook has been set, _hook_ may be "None".

   New in version 3.8.

sys.version                                        *version..sys.txt;*

   A string containing the version number of the Python interpreter
   plus additional information on the build number and compiler used.
   This string is displayed when the interactive interpreter is
   started.  Do not extract version information out of it, rather, use
   "version_info" and the functions provided by the "platform" module.

sys.api_version                                *api_version..sys.txt;*

   The C API version for this interpreter.  Programmers may find this
   useful when debugging version conflicts between Python and
   extension modules.

sys.version_info                              *version_info..sys.txt;*

   A tuple containing the five components of the version number:
   _major_, _minor_, _micro_, _releaselevel_, and _serial_.  All
   values except _releaselevel_ are integers; the release level is
   "'alpha'", "'beta'", "'candidate'", or "'final'".  The
   "version_info" value corresponding to the Python version 2.0 is
   "(2, 0, 0, 'final', 0)".  The components can also be accessed by
   name, so "sys.version_info[0]" is equivalent to
   "sys.version_info.major" and so on.

   Changed in version 3.1: Added named component attributes.

sys.warnoptions                                *warnoptions..sys.txt;*

   This is an implementation detail of the warnings framework; do not
   modify this value.  Refer to the "warnings" module for more
   information on the warnings framework.

sys.winver                                          *winver..sys.txt;*

   The version number used to form registry keys on Windows platforms.
   This is stored as string resource 1000 in the Python DLL.  The
   value is normally the major and minor versions of the running
   Python interpreter.  It is provided in the "sys" module for
   informational purposes; modifying this value has no effect on the
   registry keys used by Python.

   Availability: Windows.

sys.monitoring                                  *monitoring..sys.txt;*

   Namespace containing functions and constants for register callbacks
   and controlling monitoring events. See  "sys.monitoring" for
   details.

sys._xoptions                                    *_xoptions..sys.txt;*

   A dictionary of the various implementation-specific flags passed
   through the "-X" command-line option.  Option names are either
   mapped to their values, if given explicitly, or to "True".
   Example:
>
      $ ./python -Xa=b -Xc
      Python 3.2a3+ (py3k, Oct 16 2010, 20:14:50)
      [GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>> import sys
      >>> sys._xoptions
      {'a': 'b', 'c': True}
<
   **CPython implementation detail:** This is a CPython-specific way
   of accessing options passed through "-X".  Other implementations
   may export them through other means, or not at all.

   New in version 3.2.
