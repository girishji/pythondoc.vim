"syslog" — Unix syslog library routines
***************************************

======================================================================

This module provides an interface to the Unix "syslog" library
routines. Refer to the Unix manual pages for a detailed description of
the "syslog" facility.

This module wraps the system "syslog" family of routines.  A pure
Python library that can speak to a syslog server is available in the
"logging.handlers" module as "SysLogHandler".

Availability: not Emscripten, not WASI.

This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms
"wasm32-emscripten" and "wasm32-wasi". See WebAssembly platforms for
more information.

The module defines the following functions:

syslog.syslog(message)                          *syslog()..syslog.txt*
syslog.syslog(priority, message)

   Send the string _message_ to the system logger.  A trailing newline
   is added if necessary.  Each message is tagged with a priority
   composed of a _facility_ and a _level_.  The optional _priority_
   argument, which defaults to "LOG_INFO", determines the message
   priority.  If the facility is not encoded in _priority_ using
   logical-or ("LOG_INFO | LOG_USER"), the value given in the
   "openlog()" call is used.

   If "openlog()" has not been called prior to the call to "syslog()",
   "openlog()" will be called with no arguments.

   Raises an auditing event "syslog.syslog" with arguments "priority",
   "message".

   Changed in version 3.2: In previous versions, "openlog()" would not
   be called automatically if it wasn’t called prior to the call to
   "syslog()", deferring to the syslog implementation to call
   "openlog()".

   Changed in version 3.12: This function is restricted in
   subinterpreters. (Only code that runs in multiple interpreters is
   affected and the restriction is not relevant for most users.)
   "openlog()" must be called in the main interpreter before
   "syslog()" may be used in a subinterpreter.  Otherwise it will
   raise "RuntimeError".

                                               *openlog()..syslog.txt*
syslog.openlog([ident[, logoption[, facility]]])

   Logging options of subsequent "syslog()" calls can be set by
   calling "openlog()".  "syslog()" will call "openlog()" with no
   arguments if the log is not currently open.

   The optional _ident_ keyword argument is a string which is
   prepended to every message, and defaults to "sys.argv[0]" with
   leading path components stripped.  The optional _logoption_ keyword
   argument (default is 0) is a bit field – see below for possible
   values to combine.  The optional _facility_ keyword argument
   (default is "LOG_USER") sets the default facility for messages
   which do not have a facility explicitly encoded.

   Raises an auditing event "syslog.openlog" with arguments "ident",
   "logoption", "facility".

   Changed in version 3.2: In previous versions, keyword arguments
   were not allowed, and _ident_ was required.

   Changed in version 3.12: This function is restricted in
   subinterpreters. (Only code that runs in multiple interpreters is
   affected and the restriction is not relevant for most users.) This
   may only be called in the main interpreter. It will raise
   "RuntimeError" if called in a subinterpreter.

syslog.closelog()                             *closelog()..syslog.txt*

   Reset the syslog module values and call the system library
   "closelog()".

   This causes the module to behave as it does when initially
   imported.  For example, "openlog()" will be called on the first
   "syslog()" call (if "openlog()" hasn’t already been called), and
   _ident_ and other "openlog()" parameters are reset to defaults.

   Raises an auditing event "syslog.closelog" with no arguments.

   Changed in version 3.12: This function is restricted in
   subinterpreters. (Only code that runs in multiple interpreters is
   affected and the restriction is not relevant for most users.) This
   may only be called in the main interpreter. It will raise
   "RuntimeError" if called in a subinterpreter.

syslog.setlogmask(maskpri)                  *setlogmask()..syslog.txt*

   Set the priority mask to _maskpri_ and return the previous mask
   value.  Calls to "syslog()" with a priority level not set in
   _maskpri_ are ignored. The default is to log all priorities.  The
   function "LOG_MASK(pri)" calculates the mask for the individual
   priority _pri_.  The function "LOG_UPTO(pri)" calculates the mask
   for all priorities up to and including _pri_.

   Raises an auditing event "syslog.setlogmask" with argument
   "maskpri".

The module defines the following constants:

Priority levels (high to low):
   "LOG_EMERG", "LOG_ALERT", "LOG_CRIT", "LOG_ERR", "LOG_WARNING",
   "LOG_NOTICE", "LOG_INFO", "LOG_DEBUG".

Facilities:
   "LOG_KERN", "LOG_USER", "LOG_MAIL", "LOG_DAEMON", "LOG_AUTH",
   "LOG_LPR", "LOG_NEWS", "LOG_UUCP", "LOG_CRON", "LOG_SYSLOG",
   "LOG_LOCAL0" to "LOG_LOCAL7", and, if defined in "<syslog.h>",
   "LOG_AUTHPRIV".

Log options:
   "LOG_PID", "LOG_CONS", "LOG_NDELAY", and, if defined in
   "<syslog.h>", "LOG_ODELAY", "LOG_NOWAIT", and "LOG_PERROR".


Examples

Simple example
--------------

A simple set of examples:
>
   import syslog

   syslog.syslog('Processing started')
   if error:
       syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_ERR, 'Processing started')
<
An example of setting some log options, these would include the
process ID in logged messages, and write the messages to the
destination facility used for mail logging:
>
   syslog.openlog(logoption=syslog.LOG_PID, facility=syslog.LOG_MAIL)
   syslog.syslog('E-mail processing initiated...')
