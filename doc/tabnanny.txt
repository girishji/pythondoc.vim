"tabnanny" — Detection of ambiguous indentation
***********************************************

**Source code:** Lib/tabnanny.py

======================================================================

For the time being this module is intended to be called as a script.
However it is possible to import it into an IDE and use the function
"check()" described below.

Note:

  The API provided by this module is likely to change in future
  releases; such changes may not be backward compatible.

tabnanny.check(file_or_dir)                    *check()..tabnanny.txt*

   If _file_or_dir_ is a directory and not a symbolic link, then
   recursively descend the directory tree named by _file_or_dir_,
   checking all ".py" files along the way.  If _file_or_dir_ is an
   ordinary Python source file, it is checked for whitespace related
   problems.  The diagnostic messages are written to standard output
   using the "print()" function.

tabnanny.verbose                               *verbose..tabnanny.txt*

   Flag indicating whether to print verbose messages. This is
   incremented by the "-v" option if called as a script.

tabnanny.filename_only                   *filename_only..tabnanny.txt*

   Flag indicating whether to print only the filenames of files
   containing whitespace related problems.  This is set to true by the
   "-q" option if called as a script.

exception tabnanny.NannyNag                   *NannyNag..tabnanny.txt*

   Raised by "process_tokens()" if detecting an ambiguous indent.
   Captured and handled in "check()".

tabnanny.process_tokens(tokens)       *process_tokens()..tabnanny.txt*

   This function is used by "check()" to process tokens generated by
   the "tokenize" module.
