"wave" — Read and write WAV files
*********************************

**Source code:** Lib/wave.py

======================================================================

The "wave" module provides a convenient interface to the Waveform
Audio “WAVE” (or “WAV”) file format. Only uncompressed PCM encoded
wave files are supported.

Changed in version 3.12: Support for "WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE" headers
was added, provided that the extended format is
"KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM".

The "wave" module defines the following function and exception:

wave.open(file, mode=None)                          *open()..wave.txt*

   If _file_ is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat
   it as a file-like object.  _mode_ can be:

   "'rb'"
      Read only mode.

   "'wb'"
      Write only mode.

   Note that it does not allow read/write WAV files.

   A _mode_ of "'rb'" returns a "Wave_read" object, while a _mode_ of
   "'wb'" returns a "Wave_write" object.  If _mode_ is omitted and a
   file-like object is passed as _file_, "file.mode" is used as the
   default value for _mode_.

   If you pass in a file-like object, the wave object will not close
   it when its "close()" method is called; it is the caller’s
   responsibility to close the file object.

   The "open()" function may be used in a "with" statement.  When the
   "with" block completes, the "Wave_read.close()" or
   "Wave_write.close()" method is called.

   Changed in version 3.4: Added support for unseekable files.

exception wave.Error                                 *Error..wave.txt*

   An error raised when something is impossible because it violates
   the WAV specification or hits an implementation deficiency.


Wave_read Objects
=================

class wave.Wave_read                             *Wave_read..wave.txt*

   Read a WAV file.

   Wave_read objects, as returned by "open()", have the following
   methods:

   close()                                  *Wave_read.close()..wave.txt*

      Close the stream if it was opened by "wave", and make the
      instance unusable.  This is called automatically on object
      collection.

   getnchannels()                    *Wave_read.getnchannels()..wave.txt*

      Returns number of audio channels ("1" for mono, "2" for stereo).

   getsampwidth()                    *Wave_read.getsampwidth()..wave.txt*

      Returns sample width in bytes.

   getframerate()                    *Wave_read.getframerate()..wave.txt*

      Returns sampling frequency.

   getnframes()                        *Wave_read.getnframes()..wave.txt*

      Returns number of audio frames.

   getcomptype()                      *Wave_read.getcomptype()..wave.txt*

      Returns compression type ("'NONE'" is the only supported type).

   getcompname()                      *Wave_read.getcompname()..wave.txt*

      Human-readable version of "getcomptype()". Usually "'not
      compressed'" parallels "'NONE'".

   getparams()                          *Wave_read.getparams()..wave.txt*

      Returns a "namedtuple()" "(nchannels, sampwidth, framerate,
      nframes, comptype, compname)", equivalent to output of the
      "get*()" methods.

   readframes(n)                       *Wave_read.readframes()..wave.txt*

      Reads and returns at most _n_ frames of audio, as a "bytes"
      object.

   rewind()                                *Wave_read.rewind()..wave.txt*

      Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream.

   The following two methods are defined for compatibility with the
   old "aifc" module, and don’t do anything interesting.

   getmarkers()                        *Wave_read.getmarkers()..wave.txt*

      Returns "None".

      Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15:
      The method only existed for compatibility with the "aifc" module
      which has been removed in Python 3.13.

   getmark(id)                            *Wave_read.getmark()..wave.txt*

      Raise an error.

      Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15:
      The method only existed for compatibility with the "aifc" module
      which has been removed in Python 3.13.

   The following two methods define a term “position” which is
   compatible between them, and is otherwise implementation dependent.

   setpos(pos)                             *Wave_read.setpos()..wave.txt*

      Set the file pointer to the specified position.

   tell()                                    *Wave_read.tell()..wave.txt*

      Return current file pointer position.


Wave_write Objects
==================

class wave.Wave_write                           *Wave_write..wave.txt*

   Write a WAV file.

   Wave_write objects, as returned by "open()".

   For seekable output streams, the "wave" header will automatically
   be updated to reflect the number of frames actually written.  For
   unseekable streams, the _nframes_ value must be accurate when the
   first frame data is written.  An accurate _nframes_ value can be
   achieved either by calling "setnframes()" or "setparams()" with the
   number of frames that will be written before "close()" is called
   and then using "writeframesraw()" to write the frame data, or by
   calling "writeframes()" with all of the frame data to be written.
   In the latter case "writeframes()" will calculate the number of
   frames in the data and set _nframes_ accordingly before writing the
   frame data.

   Changed in version 3.4: Added support for unseekable files.

   Wave_write objects have the following methods:

   close()                                 *Wave_write.close()..wave.txt*

      Make sure _nframes_ is correct, and close the file if it was
      opened by "wave".  This method is called upon object collection.
      It will raise an exception if the output stream is not seekable
      and _nframes_ does not match the number of frames actually
      written.

   setnchannels(n)                  *Wave_write.setnchannels()..wave.txt*

      Set the number of channels.

   setsampwidth(n)                  *Wave_write.setsampwidth()..wave.txt*

      Set the sample width to _n_ bytes.

   setframerate(n)                  *Wave_write.setframerate()..wave.txt*

      Set the frame rate to _n_.

      Changed in version 3.2: A non-integral input to this method is
      rounded to the nearest integer.

   setnframes(n)                      *Wave_write.setnframes()..wave.txt*

      Set the number of frames to _n_.  This will be changed later if
      the number of frames actually written is different (this update
      attempt will raise an error if the output stream is not
      seekable).

   setcomptype(type, name)           *Wave_write.setcomptype()..wave.txt*

      Set the compression type and description. At the moment, only
      compression type "NONE" is supported, meaning no compression.

   setparams(tuple)                    *Wave_write.setparams()..wave.txt*

      The _tuple_ should be "(nchannels, sampwidth, framerate,
      nframes, comptype, compname)", with values valid for the
      "set*()" methods.  Sets all parameters.

   tell()                                   *Wave_write.tell()..wave.txt*

      Return current position in the file, with the same disclaimer
      for the "Wave_read.tell()" and "Wave_read.setpos()" methods.

   writeframesraw(data)           *Wave_write.writeframesraw()..wave.txt*

      Write audio frames, without correcting _nframes_.

      Changed in version 3.4: Any _bytes-like object_ is now accepted.

   writeframes(data)                 *Wave_write.writeframes()..wave.txt*

      Write audio frames and make sure _nframes_ is correct.  It will
      raise an error if the output stream is not seekable and the
      total number of frames that have been written after _data_ has
      been written does not match the previously set value for
      _nframes_.

      Changed in version 3.4: Any _bytes-like object_ is now accepted.

      Note that it is invalid to set any parameters after calling
      "writeframes()" or "writeframesraw()", and any attempt to do so
      will raise "wave.Error".
