"winreg" — Windows registry access
**********************************

======================================================================

These functions expose the Windows registry API to Python.  Instead of
using an integer as the registry handle, a handle object is used to
ensure that the handles are closed correctly, even if the programmer
neglects to explicitly close them.

Changed in version 3.3: Several functions in this module used to raise
a "WindowsError", which is now an alias of "OSError".


Functions
=========

This module offers the following functions:

winreg.CloseKey(hkey)                        *CloseKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Closes a previously opened registry key.  The _hkey_ argument
   specifies a previously opened key.

   Note:

     If _hkey_ is not closed using this method (or via
     "hkey.Close()"), it is closed when the _hkey_ object is destroyed
     by Python.

                                      *ConnectRegistry()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.ConnectRegistry(computer_name, key)

   Establishes a connection to a predefined registry handle on another
   computer, and returns a handle object.

   _computer_name_ is the name of the remote computer, of the form
   "r"\\computername"".  If "None", the local computer is used.

   _key_ is the predefined handle to connect to.

   The return value is the handle of the opened key. If the function
   fails, an "OSError" exception is raised.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.ConnectRegistry" with arguments
   "computer_name", "key".

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

winreg.CreateKey(key, sub_key)              *CreateKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Creates or opens the specified key, returning a handle object.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that names the key this method opens or
   creates.

   If _key_ is one of the predefined keys, _sub_key_ may be "None". In
   that case, the handle returned is the same key handle passed in to
   the function.

   If the key already exists, this function opens the existing key.

   The return value is the handle of the opened key. If the function
   fails, an "OSError" exception is raised.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.CreateKey" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "access".

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.OpenKey/result" with argument
   "key".

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

                                          *CreateKeyEx()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.CreateKeyEx(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_WRITE)

   Creates or opens the specified key, returning a handle object.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that names the key this method opens or
   creates.

   _reserved_ is a reserved integer, and must be zero. The default is
   zero.

   _access_ is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes
   the desired security access for the key.  Default is "KEY_WRITE".
   See Access Rights for other allowed values.

   If _key_ is one of the predefined keys, _sub_key_ may be "None". In
   that case, the handle returned is the same key handle passed in to
   the function.

   If the key already exists, this function opens the existing key.

   The return value is the handle of the opened key. If the function
   fails, an "OSError" exception is raised.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.CreateKey" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "access".

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.OpenKey/result" with argument
   "key".

   New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

winreg.DeleteKey(key, sub_key)              *DeleteKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Deletes the specified key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that must be a subkey of the key identified
   by the _key_ parameter.  This value must not be "None", and the key
   may not have subkeys.

   _This method can not delete keys with subkeys._

   If the method succeeds, the entire key, including all of its
   values, is removed. If the method fails, an "OSError" exception is
   raised.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.DeleteKey" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "access".

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

                                          *DeleteKeyEx()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.DeleteKeyEx(key, sub_key, access=KEY_WOW64_64KEY, reserved=0)

   Deletes the specified key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that must be a subkey of the key identified
   by the _key_ parameter. This value must not be "None", and the key
   may not have subkeys.

   _reserved_ is a reserved integer, and must be zero. The default is
   zero.

   _access_ is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes
   the desired security access for the key.  Default is
   "KEY_WOW64_64KEY". On 32-bit Windows, the WOW64 constants are
   ignored. See Access Rights for other allowed values.

   _This method can not delete keys with subkeys._

   If the method succeeds, the entire key, including all of its
   values, is removed. If the method fails, an "OSError" exception is
   raised.

   On unsupported Windows versions, "NotImplementedError" is raised.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.DeleteKey" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "access".

   New in version 3.2.

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

winreg.DeleteValue(key, value)            *DeleteValue()..winreg.txt;*

   Removes a named value from a registry key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _value_ is a string that identifies the value to remove.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.DeleteValue" with arguments "key",
   "value".

winreg.EnumKey(key, index)                    *EnumKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Enumerates subkeys of an open registry key, returning a string.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _index_ is an integer that identifies the index of the key to
   retrieve.

   The function retrieves the name of one subkey each time it is
   called.  It is typically called repeatedly until an "OSError"
   exception is raised, indicating, no more values are available.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.EnumKey" with arguments "key",
   "index".

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

winreg.EnumValue(key, index)                *EnumValue()..winreg.txt;*

   Enumerates values of an open registry key, returning a tuple.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _index_ is an integer that identifies the index of the value to
   retrieve.

   The function retrieves the name of one subkey each time it is
   called. It is typically called repeatedly, until an "OSError"
   exception is raised, indicating no more values.

   The result is a tuple of 3 items:

   +---------+----------------------------------------------+
   | Index   | Meaning                                      |
   |=========|==============================================|
   | "0"     | A string that identifies the value name      |
   +---------+----------------------------------------------+
   | "1"     | An object that holds the value data, and     |
   |         | whose type depends on the underlying         |
   |         | registry type                                |
   +---------+----------------------------------------------+
   | "2"     | An integer that identifies the type of the   |
   |         | value data (see table in docs for            |
   |         | "SetValueEx()")                              |
   +---------+----------------------------------------------+

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.EnumValue" with arguments "key",
   "index".

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

                             *ExpandEnvironmentStrings()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(str)

   Expands environment variable placeholders "%NAME%" in strings like
   "REG_EXPAND_SZ":
>
      >>> ExpandEnvironmentStrings('%windir%')
      'C:\\Windows'
<
   Raises an auditing event "winreg.ExpandEnvironmentStrings" with
   argument "str".

winreg.FlushKey(key)                         *FlushKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Writes all the attributes of a key to the registry.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   It is not necessary to call "FlushKey()" to change a key. Registry
   changes are flushed to disk by the registry using its lazy flusher.
   Registry changes are also flushed to disk at system shutdown.
   Unlike "CloseKey()", the "FlushKey()" method returns only when all
   the data has been written to the registry. An application should
   only call "FlushKey()" if it requires absolute certainty that
   registry changes are on disk.

   Note:

     If you don’t know whether a "FlushKey()" call is required, it
     probably isn’t.

winreg.LoadKey(key, sub_key, file_name)       *LoadKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Creates a subkey under the specified key and stores registration
   information from a specified file into that subkey.

   _key_ is a handle returned by "ConnectRegistry()" or one of the
   constants "HKEY_USERS" or "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE".

   _sub_key_ is a string that identifies the subkey to load.

   _file_name_ is the name of the file to load registry data from.
   This file must have been created with the "SaveKey()" function.
   Under the file allocation table (FAT) file system, the filename may
   not have an extension.

   A call to "LoadKey()" fails if the calling process does not have
   the "SE_RESTORE_PRIVILEGE" privilege.  Note that privileges are
   different from permissions – see the RegLoadKey documentation for
   more details.

   If _key_ is a handle returned by "ConnectRegistry()", then the path
   specified in _file_name_ is relative to the remote computer.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.LoadKey" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "file_name".

                                              *OpenKey()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.OpenKey(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_READ)

                                            *OpenKeyEx()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.OpenKeyEx(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_READ)

   Opens the specified key, returning a handle object.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that identifies the sub_key to open.

   _reserved_ is a reserved integer, and must be zero.  The default is
   zero.

   _access_ is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes
   the desired security access for the key.  Default is "KEY_READ".
   See Access Rights for other allowed values.

   The result is a new handle to the specified key.

   If the function fails, "OSError" is raised.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.OpenKey" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "access".

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.OpenKey/result" with argument
   "key".

   Changed in version 3.2: Allow the use of named arguments.

   Changed in version 3.3: See above.

winreg.QueryInfoKey(key)                 *QueryInfoKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Returns information about a key, as a tuple.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   The result is a tuple of 3 items:

   +---------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Index   | Meaning                                       |
   |=========|===============================================|
   | "0"     | An integer giving the number of sub keys this |
   |         | key has.                                      |
   +---------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | "1"     | An integer giving the number of values this   |
   |         | key has.                                      |
   +---------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | "2"     | An integer giving when the key was last       |
   |         | modified (if available) as 100’s of           |
   |         | nanoseconds since Jan 1, 1601.                |
   +---------+-----------------------------------------------+

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.QueryInfoKey" with argument "key".

winreg.QueryValue(key, sub_key)            *QueryValue()..winreg.txt;*

   Retrieves the unnamed value for a key, as a string.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that holds the name of the subkey with which
   the value is associated.  If this parameter is "None" or empty, the
   function retrieves the value set by the "SetValue()" method for the
   key identified by _key_.

   Values in the registry have name, type, and data components. This
   method retrieves the data for a key’s first value that has a "NULL"
   name. But the underlying API call doesn’t return the type, so
   always use "QueryValueEx()" if possible.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.QueryValue" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "value_name".

winreg.QueryValueEx(key, value_name)     *QueryValueEx()..winreg.txt;*

   Retrieves the type and data for a specified value name associated
   with an open registry key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _value_name_ is a string indicating the value to query.

   The result is a tuple of 2 items:

   +---------+-------------------------------------------+
   | Index   | Meaning                                   |
   |=========|===========================================|
   | "0"     | The value of the registry item.           |
   +---------+-------------------------------------------+
   | "1"     | An integer giving the registry type for   |
   |         | this value (see table in docs for         |
   |         | "SetValueEx()")                           |
   +---------+-------------------------------------------+

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.QueryValue" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "value_name".

winreg.SaveKey(key, file_name)                *SaveKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Saves the specified key, and all its subkeys to the specified file.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _file_name_ is the name of the file to save registry data to.  This
   file cannot already exist. If this filename includes an extension,
   it cannot be used on file allocation table (FAT) file systems by
   the "LoadKey()" method.

   If _key_ represents a key on a remote computer, the path described
   by _file_name_ is relative to the remote computer. The caller of
   this method must possess the **SeBackupPrivilege** security
   privilege.  Note that privileges are different than permissions –
   see the Conflicts Between User Rights and Permissions documentation
   for more details.

   This function passes "NULL" for _security_attributes_ to the API.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.SaveKey" with arguments "key",
   "file_name".

winreg.SetValue(key, sub_key, type, value)   *SetValue()..winreg.txt;*

   Associates a value with a specified key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _sub_key_ is a string that names the subkey with which the value is
   associated.

   _type_ is an integer that specifies the type of the data. Currently
   this must be "REG_SZ", meaning only strings are supported.  Use the
   "SetValueEx()" function for support for other data types.

   _value_ is a string that specifies the new value.

   If the key specified by the _sub_key_ parameter does not exist, the
   SetValue function creates it.

   Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more
   than 2048 bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames
   stored in the configuration registry.  This helps the registry
   perform efficiently.

   The key identified by the _key_ parameter must have been opened
   with "KEY_SET_VALUE" access.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.SetValue" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "type", "value".

                                           *SetValueEx()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.SetValueEx(key, value_name, reserved, type, value)

   Stores data in the value field of an open registry key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   _value_name_ is a string that names the subkey with which the value
   is associated.

   _reserved_ can be anything – zero is always passed to the API.

   _type_ is an integer that specifies the type of the data. See Value
   Types for the available types.

   _value_ is a string that specifies the new value.

   This method can also set additional value and type information for
   the specified key.  The key identified by the key parameter must
   have been opened with "KEY_SET_VALUE" access.

   To open the key, use the "CreateKey()" or "OpenKey()" methods.

   Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more
   than 2048 bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames
   stored in the configuration registry.  This helps the registry
   perform efficiently.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.SetValue" with arguments "key",
   "sub_key", "type", "value".

                                 *DisableReflectionKey()..winreg.txt;*
winreg.DisableReflectionKey(key)

   Disables registry reflection for 32-bit processes running on a
   64-bit operating system.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   Will generally raise "NotImplementedError" if executed on a 32-bit
   operating system.

   If the key is not on the reflection list, the function succeeds but
   has no effect.  Disabling reflection for a key does not affect
   reflection of any subkeys.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.DisableReflectionKey" with
   argument "key".

winreg.EnableReflectionKey(key)   *EnableReflectionKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Restores registry reflection for the specified disabled key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   Will generally raise "NotImplementedError" if executed on a 32-bit
   operating system.

   Restoring reflection for a key does not affect reflection of any
   subkeys.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.EnableReflectionKey" with argument
   "key".

winreg.QueryReflectionKey(key)     *QueryReflectionKey()..winreg.txt;*

   Determines the reflection state for the specified key.

   _key_ is an already open key, or one of the predefined HKEY_*
   constants.

   Returns "True" if reflection is disabled.

   Will generally raise "NotImplementedError" if executed on a 32-bit
   operating system.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.QueryReflectionKey" with argument
   "key".

Registry Handle Objects
=======================

This object wraps a Windows HKEY object, automatically closing it when
the object is destroyed.  To guarantee cleanup, you can call either
the "Close()" method on the object, or the "CloseKey()" function.

All registry functions in this module return one of these objects.

All registry functions in this module which accept a handle object
also accept an integer, however, use of the handle object is
encouraged.

Handle objects provide semantics for "__bool__()" – thus
>
   if handle:
       print("Yes")
<
will print "Yes" if the handle is currently valid (has not been closed
or detached).

The object also support comparison semantics, so handle objects will
compare true if they both reference the same underlying Windows handle
value.

Handle objects can be converted to an integer (e.g., using the built-
in "int()" function), in which case the underlying Windows handle
value is returned.  You can also use the "Detach()" method to return
the integer handle, and also disconnect the Windows handle from the
handle object.

PyHKEY.Close()                           *PyHKEY.Close()..winreg.txt;*

   Closes the underlying Windows handle.

   If the handle is already closed, no error is raised.

PyHKEY.Detach()                         *PyHKEY.Detach()..winreg.txt;*

   Detaches the Windows handle from the handle object.

   The result is an integer that holds the value of the handle before
   it is detached.  If the handle is already detached or closed, this
   will return zero.

   After calling this function, the handle is effectively invalidated,
   but the handle is not closed.  You would call this function when
   you need the underlying Win32 handle to exist beyond the lifetime
   of the handle object.

   Raises an auditing event "winreg.PyHKEY.Detach" with argument
   "key".

PyHKEY.__enter__()                   *PyHKEY.__enter__()..winreg.txt;*
PyHKEY.__exit__(*exc_info)            *PyHKEY.__exit__()..winreg.txt;*

   The HKEY object implements "__enter__()" and "__exit__()" and thus
   supports the context protocol for the "with" statement:
>
      with OpenKey(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, "foo") as key:
          ...  # work with key
<
   will automatically close _key_ when control leaves the "with"
   block.
