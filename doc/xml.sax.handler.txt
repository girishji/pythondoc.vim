"xml.sax.handler" — Base classes for SAX handlers
*************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/xml/sax/handler.py

======================================================================

The SAX API defines five kinds of handlers: content handlers, DTD
handlers, error handlers, entity resolvers and lexical handlers.
Applications normally only need to implement those interfaces whose
events they are interested in; they can implement the interfaces in a
single object or in multiple objects. Handler implementations should
inherit from the base classes provided in the module
"xml.sax.handler", so that all methods get default implementations.

                                 *ContentHandler..xml.sax.handler.txt*
class xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler

   This is the main callback interface in SAX, and the one most
   important to applications. The order of events in this interface
   mirrors the order of the information in the document.

class xml.sax.handler.DTDHandler     *DTDHandler..xml.sax.handler.txt*

   Handle DTD events.

   This interface specifies only those DTD events required for basic
   parsing (unparsed entities and attributes).

                                 *EntityResolver..xml.sax.handler.txt*
class xml.sax.handler.EntityResolver

   Basic interface for resolving entities. If you create an object
   implementing this interface, then register the object with your
   Parser, the parser will call the method in your object to resolve
   all external entities.

                                   *ErrorHandler..xml.sax.handler.txt*
class xml.sax.handler.ErrorHandler

   Interface used by the parser to present error and warning messages
   to the application.  The methods of this object control whether
   errors are immediately converted to exceptions or are handled in
   some other way.

                                 *LexicalHandler..xml.sax.handler.txt*
class xml.sax.handler.LexicalHandler

   Interface used by the parser to represent low frequency events
   which may not be of interest to many applications.

In addition to these classes, "xml.sax.handler" provides symbolic
constants for the feature and property names.

                             *feature_namespaces..xml.sax.handler.txt*

ContentHandler Objects
======================

Users are expected to subclass "ContentHandler" to support their
application.  The following methods are called by the parser on the
appropriate events in the input document:

            *ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator(locator)

   Called by the parser to give the application a locator for locating
   the origin of document events.

   SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely
   required) to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply the
   locator to the application by invoking this method before invoking
   any of the other methods in the DocumentHandler interface.

   The locator allows the application to determine the end position of
   any document-related event, even if the parser is not reporting an
   error. Typically, the application will use this information for
   reporting its own errors (such as character content that does not
   match an application’s business rules). The information returned by
   the locator is probably not sufficient for use with a search
   engine.

   Note that the locator will return correct information only during
   the invocation of the events in this interface. The application
   should not attempt to use it at any other time.

                 *ContentHandler.startDocument()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.startDocument()

   Receive notification of the beginning of a document.

   The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, before any other
   methods in this interface or in DTDHandler (except for
   "setDocumentLocator()").

                   *ContentHandler.endDocument()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.endDocument()

   Receive notification of the end of a document.

   The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, and it will be
   the last method invoked during the parse. The parser shall not
   invoke this method until it has either abandoned parsing (because
   of an unrecoverable error) or reached the end of input.

            *ContentHandler.startPrefixMapping()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.startPrefixMapping(prefix, uri)

   Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.

   The information from this event is not necessary for normal
   Namespace processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically replace
   prefixes for element and attribute names when the
   "feature_namespaces" feature is enabled (the default).

   There are cases, however, when applications need to use prefixes in
   character data or in attribute values, where they cannot safely be
   expanded automatically; the "startPrefixMapping()" and
   "endPrefixMapping()" events supply the information to the
   application to expand prefixes in those contexts itself, if
   necessary.

   Note that "startPrefixMapping()" and "endPrefixMapping()" events
   are not guaranteed to be properly nested relative to each-other:
   all "startPrefixMapping()" events will occur before the
   corresponding "startElement()" event, and all "endPrefixMapping()"
   events will occur after the corresponding "endElement()" event, but
   their order is not guaranteed.

              *ContentHandler.endPrefixMapping()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.endPrefixMapping(prefix)

   End the scope of a prefix-URI mapping.

   See "startPrefixMapping()" for details. This event will always
   occur after the corresponding "endElement()" event, but the order
   of "endPrefixMapping()" events is not otherwise guaranteed.

                  *ContentHandler.startElement()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.startElement(name, attrs)

   Signals the start of an element in non-namespace mode.

   The _name_ parameter contains the raw XML 1.0 name of the element
   type as a string and the _attrs_ parameter holds an object of the
   "Attributes" interface (see The Attributes Interface) containing
   the attributes of the element.  The object passed as _attrs_ may be
   re-used by the parser; holding on to a reference to it is not a
   reliable way to keep a copy of the attributes. To keep a copy of
   the attributes, use the "copy()" method of the _attrs_ object.

                    *ContentHandler.endElement()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.endElement(name)

   Signals the end of an element in non-namespace mode.

   The _name_ parameter contains the name of the element type, just as
   with the "startElement()" event.

                *ContentHandler.startElementNS()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.startElementNS(name, qname, attrs)

   Signals the start of an element in namespace mode.

   The _name_ parameter contains the name of the element type as a
   "(uri, localname)" tuple, the _qname_ parameter contains the raw
   XML 1.0 name used in the source document, and the _attrs_ parameter
   holds an instance of the "AttributesNS" interface (see The
   AttributesNS Interface) containing the attributes of the element.
   If no namespace is associated with the element, the _uri_ component
   of _name_ will be "None".  The object passed as _attrs_ may be re-
   used by the parser; holding on to a reference to it is not a
   reliable way to keep a copy of the attributes.  To keep a copy of
   the attributes, use the "copy()" method of the _attrs_ object.

   Parsers may set the _qname_ parameter to "None", unless the
   "feature_namespace_prefixes" feature is activated.

                  *ContentHandler.endElementNS()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.endElementNS(name, qname)

   Signals the end of an element in namespace mode.

   The _name_ parameter contains the name of the element type, just as
   with the "startElementNS()" method, likewise the _qname_ parameter.

                    *ContentHandler.characters()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.characters(content)

   Receive notification of character data.

   The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of character
   data. SAX parsers may return all contiguous character data in a
   single chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however,
   all of the characters in any single event must come from the same
   external entity so that the Locator provides useful information.

   _content_ may be a string or bytes instance; the "expat" reader
   module always produces strings.

   Note:

     The earlier SAX 1 interface provided by the Python XML Special
     Interest Group used a more Java-like interface for this method.
     Since most parsers used from Python did not take advantage of the
     older interface, the simpler signature was chosen to replace it.
     To convert old code to the new interface, use _content_ instead
     of slicing content with the old _offset_ and _length_ parameters.

           *ContentHandler.ignorableWhitespace()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.ignorableWhitespace(whitespace)

   Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content.

   Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk of
   ignorable whitespace (see the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation, section
   2.10): non-validating parsers may also use this method if they are
   capable of parsing and using content models.

   SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single chunk,
   or they may split it into several chunks; however, all of the
   characters in any single event must come from the same external
   entity, so that the Locator provides useful information.

         *ContentHandler.processingInstruction()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.processingInstruction(target, data)

   Receive notification of a processing instruction.

   The Parser will invoke this method once for each processing
   instruction found: note that processing instructions may occur
   before or after the main document element.

   A SAX parser should never report an XML declaration (XML 1.0,
   section 2.8) or a text declaration (XML 1.0, section 4.3.1) using
   this method.

                 *ContentHandler.skippedEntity()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ContentHandler.skippedEntity(name)

   Receive notification of a skipped entity.

   The Parser will invoke this method once for each entity skipped.
   Non-validating processors may skip entities if they have not seen
   the declarations (because, for example, the entity was declared in
   an external DTD subset). All processors may skip external entities,
   depending on the values of the "feature_external_ges" and the
   "feature_external_pes" properties.


DTDHandler Objects
==================

"DTDHandler" instances provide the following methods:

                      *DTDHandler.notationDecl()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
DTDHandler.notationDecl(name, publicId, systemId)

   Handle a notation declaration event.

                *DTDHandler.unparsedEntityDecl()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
DTDHandler.unparsedEntityDecl(name, publicId, systemId, ndata)

   Handle an unparsed entity declaration event.


EntityResolver Objects
======================

                 *EntityResolver.resolveEntity()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
EntityResolver.resolveEntity(publicId, systemId)

   Resolve the system identifier of an entity and return either the
   system identifier to read from as a string, or an InputSource to
   read from. The default implementation returns _systemId_.


ErrorHandler Objects
====================

Objects with this interface are used to receive error and warning
information from the "XMLReader".  If you create an object that
implements this interface, then register the object with your
"XMLReader", the parser will call the methods in your object to report
all warnings and errors. There are three levels of errors available:
warnings, (possibly) recoverable errors, and unrecoverable errors.
All methods take a "SAXParseException" as the only parameter.  Errors
and warnings may be converted to an exception by raising the passed-in
exception object.

                           *ErrorHandler.error()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ErrorHandler.error(exception)

   Called when the parser encounters a recoverable error.  If this
   method does not raise an exception, parsing may continue, but
   further document information should not be expected by the
   application.  Allowing the parser to continue may allow additional
   errors to be discovered in the input document.

                      *ErrorHandler.fatalError()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ErrorHandler.fatalError(exception)

   Called when the parser encounters an error it cannot recover from;
   parsing is expected to terminate when this method returns.

                         *ErrorHandler.warning()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
ErrorHandler.warning(exception)

   Called when the parser presents minor warning information to the
   application. Parsing is expected to continue when this method
   returns, and document information will continue to be passed to the
   application. Raising an exception in this method will cause parsing
   to end.


LexicalHandler Objects
======================

Optional SAX2 handler for lexical events.

This handler is used to obtain lexical information about an XML
document. Lexical information includes information describing the
document encoding used and XML comments embedded in the document, as
well as section boundaries for the DTD and for any CDATA sections. The
lexical handlers are used in the same manner as content handlers.

Set the LexicalHandler of an XMLReader by using the setProperty method
with the property identifier "'http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-
handler'".

                       *LexicalHandler.comment()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
LexicalHandler.comment(content)

   Reports a comment anywhere in the document (including the DTD and
   outside the document element).

                      *LexicalHandler.startDTD()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
LexicalHandler.startDTD(name, public_id, system_id)

   Reports the start of the DTD declarations if the document has an
   associated DTD.

                        *LexicalHandler.endDTD()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
LexicalHandler.endDTD()

   Reports the end of DTD declaration.

                    *LexicalHandler.startCDATA()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
LexicalHandler.startCDATA()

   Reports the start of a CDATA marked section.

   The contents of the CDATA marked section will be reported through
   the characters handler.

                      *LexicalHandler.endCDATA()..xml.sax.handler.txt*
LexicalHandler.endCDATA()

   Reports the end of a CDATA marked section.
