"xmlrpc" — XMLRPC server and client modules
*******************************************

XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call method that uses XML passed via
HTTP as a transport.  With it, a client can call methods with
parameters on a remote server (the server is named by a URI) and get
back structured data.

"xmlrpc" is a package that collects server and client modules
implementing XML-RPC.  The modules are:

* "xmlrpc.client"

* "xmlrpc.server"
