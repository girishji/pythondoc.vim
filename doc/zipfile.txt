"zipfile" — Work with ZIP archives
**********************************

**Source code:** Lib/zipfile/

======================================================================

The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. This
module provides tools to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP
file.  Any advanced use of this module will require an understanding
of the format, as defined in PKZIP Application Note.

This module does not currently handle multi-disk ZIP files. It can
handle ZIP files that use the ZIP64 extensions (that is ZIP files that
are more than 4 GiB in size).  It supports decryption of encrypted
files in ZIP archives, but it currently cannot create an encrypted
file.  Decryption is extremely slow as it is implemented in native
Python rather than C.

The module defines the following items:

exception zipfile.BadZipFile                 *BadZipFile..zipfile.txt*

   The error raised for bad ZIP files.

   New in version 3.2.

exception zipfile.BadZipfile                 *BadZipfile..zipfile.txt*

   Alias of "BadZipFile", for compatibility with older Python
   versions.

   Deprecated since version 3.2.

exception zipfile.LargeZipFile             *LargeZipFile..zipfile.txt*

   The error raised when a ZIP file would require ZIP64 functionality
   but that has not been enabled.

class zipfile.ZipFile                           *ZipFile..zipfile.txt*

   The class for reading and writing ZIP files.  See section ZipFile
   Objects for constructor details.

class zipfile.Path                                 *Path..zipfile.txt*

   Class that implements a subset of the interface provided by
   "pathlib.Path", including the full
   "importlib.resources.abc.Traversable" interface.

   New in version 3.8.

class zipfile.PyZipFile                       *PyZipFile..zipfile.txt*

   Class for creating ZIP archives containing Python libraries.

                                                *ZipInfo..zipfile.txt*
class zipfile.ZipInfo(filename='NoName', date_time=(1980, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0))

   Class used to represent information about a member of an archive.
   Instances of this class are returned by the "getinfo()" and
   "infolist()" methods of "ZipFile" objects.  Most users of the
   "zipfile" module will not need to create these, but only use those
   created by this module. _filename_ should be the full name of the
   archive member, and _date_time_ should be a tuple containing six
   fields which describe the time of the last modification to the
   file; the fields are described in section ZipInfo Objects.

zipfile.is_zipfile(filename)               *is_zipfile()..zipfile.txt*

   Returns "True" if _filename_ is a valid ZIP file based on its magic
   number, otherwise returns "False".  _filename_ may be a file or
   file-like object too.

   Changed in version 3.1: Support for file and file-like objects.

zipfile.ZIP_STORED                           *ZIP_STORED..zipfile.txt*

   The numeric constant for an uncompressed archive member.

zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED                       *ZIP_DEFLATED..zipfile.txt*

   The numeric constant for the usual ZIP compression method.  This
   requires the "zlib" module.

zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2                             *ZIP_BZIP2..zipfile.txt*

   The numeric constant for the BZIP2 compression method.  This
   requires the "bz2" module.

   New in version 3.3.

zipfile.ZIP_LZMA                               *ZIP_LZMA..zipfile.txt*

   The numeric constant for the LZMA compression method.  This
   requires the "lzma" module.

   New in version 3.3.

   Note:

     The ZIP file format specification has included support for bzip2
     compression since 2001, and for LZMA compression since 2006.
     However, some tools (including older Python releases) do not
     support these compression methods, and may either refuse to
     process the ZIP file altogether, or fail to extract individual
     files.

ZipFile Objects
===============

class zipfile.ZipFile(file, mode='r', compression=ZIP_STORED, allowZip64=True, compresslevel=None, *, strict_timestamps=True, metadata_encoding=None)

   Open a ZIP file, where _file_ can be a path to a file (a string), a
   file-like object or a _path-like object_.

   The _mode_ parameter should be "'r'" to read an existing file,
   "'w'" to truncate and write a new file, "'a'" to append to an
   existing file, or "'x'" to exclusively create and write a new file.
   If _mode_ is "'x'" and _file_ refers to an existing file, a
   "FileExistsError" will be raised. If _mode_ is "'a'" and _file_
   refers to an existing ZIP file, then additional files are added to
   it.  If _file_ does not refer to a ZIP file, then a new ZIP archive
   is appended to the file.  This is meant for adding a ZIP archive to
   another file (such as "python.exe").  If _mode_ is "'a'" and the
   file does not exist at all, it is created. If _mode_ is "'r'" or
   "'a'", the file should be seekable.

   _compression_ is the ZIP compression method to use when writing the
   archive, and should be "ZIP_STORED", "ZIP_DEFLATED", "ZIP_BZIP2" or
   "ZIP_LZMA"; unrecognized values will cause "NotImplementedError" to
   be raised.  If "ZIP_DEFLATED", "ZIP_BZIP2" or "ZIP_LZMA" is
   specified but the corresponding module ("zlib", "bz2" or "lzma") is
   not available, "RuntimeError" is raised. The default is
   "ZIP_STORED".

   If _allowZip64_ is "True" (the default) zipfile will create ZIP
   files that use the ZIP64 extensions when the zipfile is larger than
   4 GiB. If it is "false" "zipfile" will raise an exception when the
   ZIP file would require ZIP64 extensions.

   The _compresslevel_ parameter controls the compression level to use
   when writing files to the archive. When using "ZIP_STORED" or
   "ZIP_LZMA" it has no effect. When using "ZIP_DEFLATED" integers "0"
   through "9" are accepted (see "zlib" for more information). When
   using "ZIP_BZIP2" integers "1" through "9" are accepted (see "bz2"
   for more information).

   The _strict_timestamps_ argument, when set to "False", allows to
   zip files older than 1980-01-01 at the cost of setting the
   timestamp to 1980-01-01. Similar behavior occurs with files newer
   than 2107-12-31, the timestamp is also set to the limit.

   When mode is "'r'", _metadata_encoding_ may be set to the name of a
   codec, which will be used to decode metadata such as the names of
   members and ZIP comments.

   If the file is created with mode "'w'", "'x'" or "'a'" and then
   "closed" without adding any files to the archive, the appropriate
   ZIP structures for an empty archive will be written to the file.

   ZipFile is also a context manager and therefore supports the "with"
   statement.  In the example, _myzip_ is closed after the "with"
   statement’s suite is finished—even if an exception occurs:
>
      with ZipFile('spam.zip', 'w') as myzip:
          myzip.write('eggs.txt')
<
   Note:

     _metadata_encoding_ is an instance-wide setting for the ZipFile.
     It is not currently possible to set this on a per-member
     basis.This attribute is a workaround for legacy implementations
     which produce archives with names in the current locale encoding
     or code page (mostly on Windows).  According to the .ZIP
     standard, the encoding of metadata may be specified to be either
     IBM code page (default) or UTF-8 by a flag in the archive header.
     That flag takes precedence over _metadata_encoding_, which is a
     Python-specific extension.

   New in version 3.2: Added the ability to use "ZipFile" as a context
   manager.

   Changed in version 3.3: Added support for "bzip2" and "lzma"
   compression.

   Changed in version 3.4: ZIP64 extensions are enabled by default.

   Changed in version 3.5: Added support for writing to unseekable
   streams. Added support for the "'x'" mode.

   Changed in version 3.6: Previously, a plain "RuntimeError" was
   raised for unrecognized compression values.

   Changed in version 3.6.2: The _file_ parameter accepts a _path-like
   object_.

   Changed in version 3.7: Add the _compresslevel_ parameter.

   New in version 3.8: The _strict_timestamps_ keyword-only argument

   Changed in version 3.11: Added support for specifying member name
   encoding for reading metadata in the zipfile’s directory and file
   headers.

ZipFile.close()                         *ZipFile.close()..zipfile.txt*

   Close the archive file.  You must call "close()" before exiting
   your program or essential records will not be written.

ZipFile.getinfo(name)                 *ZipFile.getinfo()..zipfile.txt*

   Return a "ZipInfo" object with information about the archive member
   _name_.  Calling "getinfo()" for a name not currently contained in
   the archive will raise a "KeyError".

ZipFile.infolist()                   *ZipFile.infolist()..zipfile.txt*

   Return a list containing a "ZipInfo" object for each member of the
   archive.  The objects are in the same order as their entries in the
   actual ZIP file on disk if an existing archive was opened.

ZipFile.namelist()                   *ZipFile.namelist()..zipfile.txt*

   Return a list of archive members by name.

                                         *ZipFile.open()..zipfile.txt*
ZipFile.open(name, mode='r', pwd=None, *, force_zip64=False)

   Access a member of the archive as a binary file-like object.
   _name_ can be either the name of a file within the archive or a
   "ZipInfo" object.  The _mode_ parameter, if included, must be "'r'"
   (the default) or "'w'".  _pwd_ is the password used to decrypt
   encrypted ZIP files as a "bytes" object.

   "open()" is also a context manager and therefore supports the
   "with" statement:
>
      with ZipFile('spam.zip') as myzip:
          with myzip.open('eggs.txt') as myfile:
              print(myfile.read())
<
   With _mode_ "'r'" the file-like object ("ZipExtFile") is read-only
   and provides the following methods: "read()", "readline()",
   "readlines()", "seek()", "tell()", "__iter__()", "__next__()".
   These objects can operate independently of the ZipFile.

   With "mode='w'", a writable file handle is returned, which supports
   the "write()" method.  While a writable file handle is open,
   attempting to read or write other files in the ZIP file will raise
   a "ValueError".

   When writing a file, if the file size is not known in advance but
   may exceed 2 GiB, pass "force_zip64=True" to ensure that the header
   format is capable of supporting large files.  If the file size is
   known in advance, construct a "ZipInfo" object with "file_size"
   set, and use that as the _name_ parameter.

   Note:

     The "open()", "read()" and "extract()" methods can take a
     filename or a "ZipInfo" object.  You will appreciate this when
     trying to read a ZIP file that contains members with duplicate
     names.

   Changed in version 3.6: Removed support of "mode='U'".  Use
   "io.TextIOWrapper" for reading compressed text files in _universal
   newlines_ mode.

   Changed in version 3.6: "ZipFile.open()" can now be used to write
   files into the archive with the "mode='w'" option.

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "open()" on a closed ZipFile will
   raise a "ValueError". Previously, a "RuntimeError" was raised.

                                      *ZipFile.extract()..zipfile.txt*
ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)

   Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory;
   _member_ must be its full name or a "ZipInfo" object.  Its file
   information is extracted as accurately as possible.  _path_
   specifies a different directory to extract to.  _member_ can be a
   filename or a "ZipInfo" object. _pwd_ is the password used for
   encrypted files as a "bytes" object.

   Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).

   Note:

     If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint
     and leading (back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.: "///foo/bar"
     becomes "foo/bar" on Unix, and "C:\foo\bar" becomes "foo\bar" on
     Windows. And all "".."" components in a member filename will be
     removed, e.g.: "../../foo../../ba..r" becomes "foo../ba..r".  On
     Windows illegal characters (":", "<", ">", "|", """, "?", and
     "*") replaced by underscore ("_").

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "extract()" on a closed ZipFile
   will raise a "ValueError".  Previously, a "RuntimeError" was
   raised.

   Changed in version 3.6.2: The _path_ parameter accepts a _path-like
   object_.

                                   *ZipFile.extractall()..zipfile.txt*
ZipFile.extractall(path=None, members=None, pwd=None)

   Extract all members from the archive to the current working
   directory.  _path_ specifies a different directory to extract to.
   _members_ is optional and must be a subset of the list returned by
   "namelist()".  _pwd_ is the password used for encrypted files as a
   "bytes" object.

   Warning:

     Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior
     inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of
     _path_, e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with
     ""/"" or filenames with two dots "".."".  This module attempts to
     prevent that. See "extract()" note.

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "extractall()" on a closed ZipFile
   will raise a "ValueError".  Previously, a "RuntimeError" was
   raised.

   Changed in version 3.6.2: The _path_ parameter accepts a _path-like
   object_.

ZipFile.printdir()                   *ZipFile.printdir()..zipfile.txt*

   Print a table of contents for the archive to "sys.stdout".

ZipFile.setpassword(pwd)          *ZipFile.setpassword()..zipfile.txt*

   Set _pwd_ (a "bytes" object) as default password to extract
   encrypted files.

ZipFile.read(name, pwd=None)             *ZipFile.read()..zipfile.txt*

   Return the bytes of the file _name_ in the archive.  _name_ is the
   name of the file in the archive, or a "ZipInfo" object.  The
   archive must be open for read or append. _pwd_ is the password used
   for encrypted files as a "bytes" object and, if specified,
   overrides the default password set with "setpassword()". Calling
   "read()" on a ZipFile that uses a compression method other than
   "ZIP_STORED", "ZIP_DEFLATED", "ZIP_BZIP2" or "ZIP_LZMA" will raise
   a "NotImplementedError". An error will also be raised if the
   corresponding compression module is not available.

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "read()" on a closed ZipFile will
   raise a "ValueError". Previously, a "RuntimeError" was raised.

ZipFile.testzip()                     *ZipFile.testzip()..zipfile.txt*

   Read all the files in the archive and check their CRC’s and file
   headers. Return the name of the first bad file, or else return
   "None".

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "testzip()" on a closed ZipFile
   will raise a "ValueError".  Previously, a "RuntimeError" was
   raised.

                                        *ZipFile.write()..zipfile.txt*
ZipFile.write(filename, arcname=None, compress_type=None, compresslevel=None)

   Write the file named _filename_ to the archive, giving it the
   archive name _arcname_ (by default, this will be the same as
   _filename_, but without a drive letter and with leading path
   separators removed).  If given, _compress_type_ overrides the value
   given for the _compression_ parameter to the constructor for the
   new entry. Similarly, _compresslevel_ will override the constructor
   if given. The archive must be open with mode "'w'", "'x'" or "'a'".

   Note:

     The ZIP file standard historically did not specify a metadata
     encoding, but strongly recommended CP437 (the original IBM PC
     encoding) for interoperability.  Recent versions allow use of
     UTF-8 (only).  In this module, UTF-8 will automatically be used
     to write the member names if they contain any non-ASCII
     characters.  It is not possible to write member names in any
     encoding other than ASCII or UTF-8.

   Note:

     Archive names should be relative to the archive root, that is,
     they should not start with a path separator.

   Note:

     If "arcname" (or "filename", if "arcname" is  not given) contains
     a null byte, the name of the file in the archive will be
     truncated at the null byte.

   Note:

     A leading slash in the filename may lead to the archive being
     impossible to open in some zip programs on Windows systems.

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "write()" on a ZipFile created with
   mode "'r'" or a closed ZipFile will raise a "ValueError".
   Previously, a "RuntimeError" was raised.

                                     *ZipFile.writestr()..zipfile.txt*
ZipFile.writestr(zinfo_or_arcname, data, compress_type=None, compresslevel=None)

   Write a file into the archive.  The contents is _data_, which may
   be either a "str" or a "bytes" instance; if it is a "str", it is
   encoded as UTF-8 first.  _zinfo_or_arcname_ is either the file name
   it will be given in the archive, or a "ZipInfo" instance.  If it’s
   an instance, at least the filename, date, and time must be given.
   If it’s a name, the date and time is set to the current date and
   time. The archive must be opened with mode "'w'", "'x'" or "'a'".

   If given, _compress_type_ overrides the value given for the
   _compression_ parameter to the constructor for the new entry, or in
   the _zinfo_or_arcname_ (if that is a "ZipInfo" instance).
   Similarly, _compresslevel_ will override the constructor if given.

   Note:

     When passing a "ZipInfo" instance as the _zinfo_or_arcname_
     parameter, the compression method used will be that specified in
     the _compress_type_ member of the given "ZipInfo" instance.  By
     default, the "ZipInfo" constructor sets this member to
     "ZIP_STORED".

   Changed in version 3.2: The _compress_type_ argument.

   Changed in version 3.6: Calling "writestr()" on a ZipFile created
   with mode "'r'" or a closed ZipFile will raise a "ValueError".
   Previously, a "RuntimeError" was raised.

                                        *ZipFile.mkdir()..zipfile.txt*
ZipFile.mkdir(zinfo_or_directory, mode=511)

   Create a directory inside the archive.  If _zinfo_or_directory_ is
   a string, a directory is created inside the archive with the mode
   that is specified in the _mode_ argument. If, however,
   _zinfo_or_directory_ is a "ZipInfo" instance then the _mode_
   argument is ignored.

   The archive must be opened with mode "'w'", "'x'" or "'a'".

   New in version 3.11.

The following data attributes are also available:

ZipFile.filename                       *ZipFile.filename..zipfile.txt*

   Name of the ZIP file.

ZipFile.debug                             *ZipFile.debug..zipfile.txt*

   The level of debug output to use.  This may be set from "0" (the
   default, no output) to "3" (the most output).  Debugging
   information is written to "sys.stdout".

ZipFile.comment                         *ZipFile.comment..zipfile.txt*

   The comment associated with the ZIP file as a "bytes" object. If
   assigning a comment to a "ZipFile" instance created with mode
   "'w'", "'x'" or "'a'", it should be no longer than 65535 bytes.
   Comments longer than this will be truncated.


Path Objects
============

class zipfile.Path(root, at='')

   Construct a Path object from a "root" zipfile (which may be a
   "ZipFile" instance or "file" suitable for passing to the "ZipFile"
   constructor).

   "at" specifies the location of this Path within the zipfile, e.g.
   ‘dir/file.txt’, ‘dir/’, or ‘’. Defaults to the empty string,
   indicating the root.

Path objects expose the following features of "pathlib.Path" objects:

Path objects are traversable using the "/" operator or "joinpath".

Path.name                                     *Path.name..zipfile.txt*

   The final path component.

Path.open(mode='r', *, pwd, **)             *Path.open()..zipfile.txt*

   Invoke "ZipFile.open()" on the current path. Allows opening for
   read or write, text or binary through supported modes: ‘r’, ‘w’,
   ‘rb’, ‘wb’. Positional and keyword arguments are passed through to
   "io.TextIOWrapper" when opened as text and ignored otherwise. "pwd"
   is the "pwd" parameter to "ZipFile.open()".

   Changed in version 3.9: Added support for text and binary modes for
   open. Default mode is now text.

   Changed in version 3.11.2: The "encoding" parameter can be supplied
   as a positional argument without causing a "TypeError". As it could
   in 3.9. Code needing to be compatible with unpatched 3.10 and 3.11
   versions must pass all "io.TextIOWrapper" arguments, "encoding"
   included, as keywords.

Path.iterdir()                           *Path.iterdir()..zipfile.txt*

   Enumerate the children of the current directory.

Path.is_dir()                             *Path.is_dir()..zipfile.txt*

   Return "True" if the current context references a directory.

Path.is_file()                           *Path.is_file()..zipfile.txt*

   Return "True" if the current context references a file.

Path.exists()                             *Path.exists()..zipfile.txt*

   Return "True" if the current context references a file or directory
   in the zip file.

Path.suffix                                 *Path.suffix..zipfile.txt*

   The last dot-separated portion of the final component, if any. This
   is commonly called the file extension.

   New in version 3.11: Added "Path.suffix" property.

Path.stem                                     *Path.stem..zipfile.txt*

   The final path component, without its suffix.

   New in version 3.11: Added "Path.stem" property.

Path.suffixes                             *Path.suffixes..zipfile.txt*

   A list of the path’s suffixes, commonly called file extensions.

   New in version 3.11: Added "Path.suffixes" property.

Path.read_text(*, **)                  *Path.read_text()..zipfile.txt*

   Read the current file as unicode text. Positional and keyword
   arguments are passed through to "io.TextIOWrapper" (except
   "buffer", which is implied by the context).

   Changed in version 3.11.2: The "encoding" parameter can be supplied
   as a positional argument without causing a "TypeError". As it could
   in 3.9. Code needing to be compatible with unpatched 3.10 and 3.11
   versions must pass all "io.TextIOWrapper" arguments, "encoding"
   included, as keywords.

Path.read_bytes()                     *Path.read_bytes()..zipfile.txt*

   Read the current file as bytes.

Path.joinpath(*other)                   *Path.joinpath()..zipfile.txt*

   Return a new Path object with each of the _other_ arguments joined.
   The following are equivalent:
>
      >>> Path(...).joinpath('child').joinpath('grandchild')
      >>> Path(...).joinpath('child', 'grandchild')
      >>> Path(...) / 'child' / 'grandchild'
<
   Changed in version 3.10: Prior to 3.10, "joinpath" was undocumented
   and accepted exactly one parameter.

The zipp project provides backports of the latest path object
functionality to older Pythons. Use "zipp.Path" in place of
"zipfile.Path" for early access to changes.


PyZipFile Objects
=================

The "PyZipFile" constructor takes the same parameters as the "ZipFile"
constructor, and one additional parameter, _optimize_.

class zipfile.PyZipFile(file, mode='r', compression=ZIP_STORED, allowZip64=True, optimize=-1)

   New in version 3.2: The _optimize_ parameter.

   Changed in version 3.4: ZIP64 extensions are enabled by default.

   Instances have one method in addition to those of "ZipFile"
   objects:

                                    *PyZipFile.writepy()..zipfile.txt*
   writepy(pathname, basename='', filterfunc=None)

      Search for files "*.py" and add the corresponding file to the
      archive.

      If the _optimize_ parameter to "PyZipFile" was not given or
      "-1", the corresponding file is a "*.pyc" file, compiling if
      necessary.

      If the _optimize_ parameter to "PyZipFile" was "0", "1" or "2",
      only files with that optimization level (see "compile()") are
      added to the archive, compiling if necessary.

      If _pathname_ is a file, the filename must end with ".py", and
      just the (corresponding "*.pyc") file is added at the top level
      (no path information).  If _pathname_ is a file that does not
      end with ".py", a "RuntimeError" will be raised.  If it is a
      directory, and the directory is not a package directory, then
      all the files "*.pyc" are added at the top level.  If the
      directory is a package directory, then all "*.pyc" are added
      under the package name as a file path, and if any subdirectories
      are package directories, all of these are added recursively in
      sorted order.

      _basename_ is intended for internal use only.

      _filterfunc_, if given, must be a function taking a single
      string argument.  It will be passed each path (including each
      individual full file path) before it is added to the archive.
      If _filterfunc_ returns a false value, the path will not be
      added, and if it is a directory its contents will be ignored.
      For example, if our test files are all either in "test"
      directories or start with the string "test_", we can use a
      _filterfunc_ to exclude them:
>
         >>> zf = PyZipFile('myprog.zip')
         >>> def notests(s):
         ...     fn = os.path.basename(s)
         ...     return (not (fn == 'test' or fn.startswith('test_')))
         ...
         >>> zf.writepy('myprog', filterfunc=notests)
<
      The "writepy()" method makes archives with file names like this:
>
         string.pyc                   # Top level name
         test/__init__.pyc            # Package directory
         test/testall.pyc             # Module test.testall
         test/bogus/__init__.pyc      # Subpackage directory
         test/bogus/myfile.pyc        # Submodule test.bogus.myfile
<
      New in version 3.4: The _filterfunc_ parameter.

      Changed in version 3.6.2: The _pathname_ parameter accepts a
      _path-like object_.

      Changed in version 3.7: Recursion sorts directory entries.


ZipInfo Objects
===============

Instances of the "ZipInfo" class are returned by the "getinfo()" and
"infolist()" methods of "ZipFile" objects.  Each object stores
information about a single member of the ZIP archive.

There is one classmethod to make a "ZipInfo" instance for a filesystem
file:

                                    *ZipInfo.from_file()..zipfile.txt*
classmethod ZipInfo.from_file(filename, arcname=None, *, strict_timestamps=True)

   Construct a "ZipInfo" instance for a file on the filesystem, in
   preparation for adding it to a zip file.

   _filename_ should be the path to a file or directory on the
   filesystem.

   If _arcname_ is specified, it is used as the name within the
   archive. If _arcname_ is not specified, the name will be the same
   as _filename_, but with any drive letter and leading path
   separators removed.

   The _strict_timestamps_ argument, when set to "False", allows to
   zip files older than 1980-01-01 at the cost of setting the
   timestamp to 1980-01-01. Similar behavior occurs with files newer
   than 2107-12-31, the timestamp is also set to the limit.

   New in version 3.6.

   Changed in version 3.6.2: The _filename_ parameter accepts a _path-
   like object_.

   New in version 3.8: The _strict_timestamps_ keyword-only argument

Instances have the following methods and attributes:

ZipInfo.is_dir()                       *ZipInfo.is_dir()..zipfile.txt*

   Return "True" if this archive member is a directory.

   This uses the entry’s name: directories should always end with "/".

   New in version 3.6.

ZipInfo.filename                       *ZipInfo.filename..zipfile.txt*

   Name of the file in the archive.

ZipInfo.date_time                     *ZipInfo.date_time..zipfile.txt*

   The time and date of the last modification to the archive member.
   This is a tuple of six values:

   +---------+----------------------------+
   | Index   | Value                      |
   |=========|============================|
   | "0"     | Year (>= 1980)             |
   +---------+----------------------------+
   | "1"     | Month (one-based)          |
   +---------+----------------------------+
   | "2"     | Day of month (one-based)   |
   +---------+----------------------------+
   | "3"     | Hours (zero-based)         |
   +---------+----------------------------+
   | "4"     | Minutes (zero-based)       |
   +---------+----------------------------+
   | "5"     | Seconds (zero-based)       |
   +---------+----------------------------+

   Note:

     The ZIP file format does not support timestamps before 1980.

ZipInfo.extra                             *ZipInfo.extra..zipfile.txt*

   Expansion field data.  The PKZIP Application Note contains some
   comments on the internal structure of the data contained in this
   "bytes" object.

ZipInfo.create_system             *ZipInfo.create_system..zipfile.txt*

Command-Line Interface
======================

The "zipfile" module provides a simple command-line interface to
interact with ZIP archives.

If you want to create a new ZIP archive, specify its name after the
"-c" option and then list the filename(s) that should be included:
>
   $ python -m zipfile -c monty.zip spam.txt eggs.txt
<
Passing a directory is also acceptable:
>
   $ python -m zipfile -c monty.zip life-of-brian_1979/
<
If you want to extract a ZIP archive into the specified directory, use
the "-e" option:
>
   $ python -m zipfile -e monty.zip target-dir/
<
For a list of the files in a ZIP archive, use the "-l" option:
>
   $ python -m zipfile -l monty.zip
<

Command-line options
--------------------

-l <zipfile>
--list <zipfile>

   List files in a zipfile.

-c <zipfile> <source1> ... <sourceN>
--create <zipfile> <source1> ... <sourceN>

   Create zipfile from source files.

-e <zipfile> <output_dir>
--extract <zipfile> <output_dir>

   Extract zipfile into target directory.

-t <zipfile>
--test <zipfile>

   Test whether the zipfile is valid or not.

--metadata-encoding <encoding>

   Specify encoding of member names for "-l", "-e" and "-t".

   New in version 3.11.


Decompression pitfalls
======================

The extraction in zipfile module might fail due to some pitfalls
listed below.


From file itself
----------------

Decompression may fail due to incorrect password / CRC checksum / ZIP
format or unsupported compression method / decryption.


File System limitations
-----------------------

Exceeding limitations on different file systems can cause
decompression failed. Such as allowable characters in the directory
entries, length of the file name, length of the pathname, size of a
single file, and number of files, etc.


Resources limitations
---------------------

The lack of memory or disk volume would lead to decompression failed.
For example, decompression bombs (aka ZIP bomb) apply to zipfile
library that can cause disk volume exhaustion.


Interruption
------------

Interruption during the decompression, such as pressing control-C or
killing the decompression process may result in incomplete
decompression of the archive.


Default behaviors of extraction
-------------------------------

Not knowing the default extraction behaviors can cause unexpected
decompression results. For example, when extracting the same archive
twice, it overwrites files without asking.
